I’m thrilled for you to be here and come along for the ride.This space documents my journey on thinking with a Christian perspective – about Scripture, the world we inhabit and the tools shaping our lives. And right now in 2026, one of the most influential tools in that landscape is artificial intelligence (AI).Setting the scene: AI is here to stayWhen I speak about AI, I’m referring to today’s large language models (LLMs) that now shape everyday digital life – tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Meta AI and DeepSeek.1 In fact, I co‑created this post with Microsoft Copilot, using it as a tool to draft, question and stress‑test the ideas and the activity you’ll see shortly (I promise it’s worth it).AI entrepreneur Mustafa Suleyman, in The Coming Wave, describes how technological waves tend to spread once they begin. People often resist new inventions, but over time demand usually carries them forward. Technologies evolve, replace older forms and reshape daily life. AI is part of that momentum – a wave already moving through our world.In his book 2084, mathematician and theologian John Lennox traces how technology has always extended human ability. The industrial revolution introduced machines that took on physical labour. Today’s AI systems extend that pattern into both physical and mental work. AI sits within a long story of human innovation – another chapter in our ongoing effort to build tools that amplify what we can do.Lennox also emphasises that if AI is becoming part of everyday life, then Christian engagement must be grounded in the same ethical commitments that have shaped believers for centuries: truthfulness, respect for others, responsibility, discernment and love. These are not optional extras. They are the posture that allows Christians to walk wisely in a world where our tools are powerful and our choices matter.It’s tempting to think of AI as something we use only for practical, secular tasks. But the way we use technology in one part of life always forms us in others. If AI is becoming part of our daily rhythms, then we should bring the same discernment and truthfulness into those interactions that we bring into our walk with God. These virtues will bear fruit across all our interactions with AI, whether the task is secular or spiritual.Taken together, these perspectives help us approach AI delicately. It’s a powerful tool, and it’s here to stay. The critical question for Christians becomes: How do we engage with AI in a way that preserves agency, honours Scripture and stays attentive to the Holy Spirit?Coles to Bunnings: a spiritual formation postureAt my church, Full Gospel Assembly Melbourne (FGAM), we often use a Coles to Bunnings analogy. For those who don’t know, Coles and Bunnings are two popular Australian retailers – Coles is a supermarket and Bunnings is a hardware store. Coles is a place where you pick something off the shelf – ready‑made and pre‑packaged. Bunnings is a place where you build something – where you participate, shape and take ownership.At FGAM, we aim to cultivate a faith that is more than just Coles, and has a Bunnings dimension. Indeed, much of our spiritual diet sits in ‘Coles mode’: sermons, devotionals, podcasts, commentaries. They’re good gifts, but they’re still pre‑made.My aim for theological formation posts is to invite us into ‘Bunnings mode’: a hands‑on, counter-cultural way of engaging with Scripture and the world, where we practise reflection and discernment. That’s the spirit of this post.And when it comes to AI, the same posture matters. We can use these tools in: ‘Coles mode’ – outsourcing our thinking and grabbing ready‑made answers ‘Bunnings mode’ – where AI becomes a tool on the workbench that supports our discernment rather than replacing it.Here’s how the analogy plays out when we bring AI into the picture. 🛒 Coles AI – consumer mode (automation) 🔨 Bunnings AI – workbench mode (augmentation) How most people use AI:• ‘Give me the answer.’• ‘Do this for me.’ The mode we want:• ‘Help me build something.’• ‘Reflect back what I’m saying.’• ‘Ask me questions.’• ‘Support my discernment.’• ‘Help me think, not think for me.’ Fast, convenient, transactional Slow, deliberate, formative Encourages passivity and outsourcing Encourages participation and engagement Feels like grabbing a product off a shelf Feels like working with tools at a bench Spiritual danger – mirrors consumeristic faith:• ‘Feed me.’• ‘Fix me.’• ‘Tell me what to do.’• ‘Do my thinking for me.’ Spiritual alignment – mirrors lived, organic faith:• formation over consumption• participation over passivity• discernment over outsourcing• wisdom over shortcuts This is the opposite of discipleship This is the kind of AI use that forms people rather than feeds them This post explores one small, practical way to do that:a spiritually aware, agency‑preserving way to use AI for deep reflection – through the simple practice of sitting with your Bible anchor verse.If you’d like to jump straight to the activity, feel free. But the grounding that follows is what makes the activity spiritually safe, wise and genuinely formative, so I encourage you to sit with it first.A spiritually wise posture for engaging AIAs AI becomes part of everyday life, Christians need a way of engaging with it that is spiritually grounded, theologically safe and attentive to the Holy Spirit – in both ordinary tasks and moments of spiritual reflection. This section offers one such posture.Before we begin, it’s worth naming a few things clearly. AI is not a spiritual authority – it cannot replace Scripture, the Holy Spirit or the embodied wisdom of the church. AI can generate confident but inaccurate or unorthodox interpretations – which is why we hold it lightly and keep strong guardrails. Different AI systems carry different moral and religious assumptions – shaped by their training and design, so your discernment matters more than an AI’s polish or confidence. AI is not a shortcut to spiritual insight – we use it to support slower reflection, not instant answers or spiritual certainty. AI should never displace prayer or presence – it sits downstream of prayerful attention, not in place of it.Balancing technology and the Holy SpiritAI can aid biblical research and interpretation by gathering insights and organising ideas quickly. But it is a tool to support, not replace, the Holy Spirit’s work of illumination and transformation.The Spirit guides us beyond facts – bringing wisdom, conviction and personal application. AI insights must be tested through prayer, Scripture and community discernment to align with God’s Spirit.Used with humility, AI can free mental space and offer fresh perspectives – but the Spirit is the one who shapes our hearts and character. Keeping that distinction clear protects our agency and ensures AI serves the Spirit’s work rather than substituting for it.This is why our posture matters. If we approach AI in ‘Coles mode’, we risk outsourcing discernment. But in ‘Bunnings mode’, AI becomes a tool that supports the Spirit’s work rather than competing with it.Guardrails for agency‑preserving AI useTo use AI in a way that honours the Spirit and preserves our agency, we need clear guardrails. These are the posture that keeps AI in its proper place.1. AI is a mirror, not a master. It reflects your words back to you. It does not define you. It does not decide for you. It is not a person – it doesn’t know you, love you or guide you. Treat AI as a tool, not a relationship or source of spiritual authority.2. Your discernment, Scripture, the Holy Spirit and wise counsel always come first. AI can generate confident but unorthodox interpretations, so we keep Scripture and the Spirit’s guidance at the centre. You may ignore anything unaligned with Scripture, orthodox teaching, the Spirit or your conscience. Wise counsel helps you test insights in community, grounding your reflections in the lived wisdom of the church. If AI says something that feels off – even if it sounds confident or reasonable – you can simply say: ‘That does not resonate, let’s explore another angle.’ 3. You remain responsible for decisions and outcomes. AI can prompt reflection, but it cannot bear responsibility for your choices. You remain accountable for how insights are weighed, tested and acted upon. Only the Holy Spirit brings conviction, transformation and wisdom.4. You are responsible for how AI forms you. It is your agency to reflect, probe, redirect, slow down or disengage as needed. AI is a partner in reflection, not a passive source or a substitute for spiritual formation.These guardrails shape how we’ll use AI in the activity below – always as a tool on the workbench, never as a substitute for discernment, Scripture or the Spirit.A gentle self-check for healthy AI useA helpful way to stay grounded is to pause occasionally and notice your posture. These questions are about staying spiritually centred and relationally healthy.1. Am I treating AI as a tool or as a person? Tools support your thinking. People know you, love you and walk with you.If you feel yourself slipping into relational language, simply re‑centre: ‘This is a tool helping me reflect – not someone guiding me.’2. Am I expecting AI to give me comfort, validation or spiritual direction?AI can reflect your words back with clarity, but it cannot offer care, wisdom or presence.If you notice yourself turning to it for reassurance, pause and redirect that need toward God, trusted people or prayer.3. Am I outsourcing something that belongs to my agency, conscience or the Spirit?A healthy posture sounds like: ‘Help me think.’ ‘Reflect this back.’ ‘Ask me questions.’A risky posture sounds like: ‘Tell me what to do.’ ‘Fix this for me.’ ‘Decide for me.’4. Am I still bringing Scripture, prayer and community into the process?AI can help you explore ideas, but it cannot replace the Spirit’s work or the wisdom of people who know your life.5. Do I feel more formed or more dependent after using AI?Healthy use strengthens: clarity agency discernment groundedness.Unhealthy use increases: reliance emotional attachment avoidance of real relationships spiritual passivity.If you notice drift, simply recalibrate – the guardrails are there to help you return to a wise posture.Bible anchor verse activityHere is the activity I developed in conjunction with Microsoft Copilot, intentionally designed to model wise, agency‑preserving AI use.Activity overviewA simple activity that models wise, agency‑preserving AI use for spiritual reflection – moving from ‘Coles AI’ automation to ‘Bunnings AI’ augmentation.You’ll work with your Bible anchor verse, using AI to help you explore why it resonates, name your heart posture and notice what’s happening in your current season. A gentle 7-stage continuum then gives language to these postures, helping you discern the movement you sense and consider how you might grow in living out your verse.Afterwards, a set of reflection prompts helps you process how the experience actually felt. Throughout the activity, strong guardrails keep AI in its proper place – supporting your thinking, not replacing your agency, discernment, the Spirit or wise counsel.For facilitators: this activity can be run as a group activity, with facilitator notes and discussion questions available on Copilot Pages.Movement 1: Prime and discoverGoal: Set the AI into a gentle, reflective mode and begin exploring your anchor verse – either by naming the one you already hold close, or by discovering it through a few guided questions.What is an anchor verse?An anchor verse is a Bible verse that grounds your faith, identity or spiritual posture – often the verse you return to most or keep close to heart.Before you begin, paste this prompt into your AI to set the tone for the reflection: My goal is to work with my Bible anchor verse and reflect on how I’m living it out.Please respond in a gentle, reflective, spiritually sensitive way.Help me discern, not decide. Reflect back what I share, but don’t tell me what to do.Avoid pressure or performance language. Ask clarifying questions when needed.Keep reflections Christ‑centred, faithful to Scripture and orthodox – never speculative or novel.Please wait for my next instruction before proceeding.My goal is to work with my Bible anchor verse and reflect on how I'm living it out.Please respond in a gentle, reflective, spiritually sensitive way.Help me discern, not decide. Reflect back what I share, but don't tell me what to do.Avoid pressure or performance language. Ask clarifying questions when needed.Keep reflections Christ-centred, faithful to Scripture and orthodox -- never speculative or novel.Please wait for my next instruction before proceeding.If you already know your anchor verse, continue with: My anchor verse is ___.I chose this verse because [share why you chose it and what you relate to in it].My anchor verse is ___.I chose this verse because [share why you chose it and what you relate to in it].If you don’t yet know your anchor verse, you can ask the AI to help you discover it: Help me identify my anchor verse. Ask me 3–4 gentle questions to help me discover the verse that feels like mine.Help me identify my anchor verse. Ask me 3--4 gentle questions to help me discover the verse that feels like mine.Take a few minutes to interact with the AI and let the reflection begin to unfold.Movement 2: Notice and nameThis is the centrepiece of the activity.❤️ 2A. Heart postureGoal: Begin naming the heart posture that sits beneath your anchor verse.Prompt AI: Based on my anchor verse, what heart posture does this reveal?Am I relating to God through comfort, truth, surrender, mission, dependence or something else? (Optional: If helpful, please include exegesis and context, but only if it supports reflection.)Based on my anchor verse, what heart posture does this reveal?Am I relating to God through comfort, truth, surrender, mission, dependence or something else?(Optional: If helpful, please include exegesis and context, but only if it supports reflection.)As you read the response, pay attention to what resonates and what doesn’t. Notice where you feel seen, where you feel challenged and where the language doesn’t quite fit. You’re free to ask follow‑up questions, clarify or gently redirect the AI so it better reflects what’s true of your current posture.↔️ 2B. ContinuumGoal: Create language that helps you notice how close this verse feels to your lived experience right now.Prompt AI: Create a clear 7-stage continuum for my anchor verse from aspirational → integrated, grounded in its context.The stages are: aspirational → aware → stirred → resonating → practising → embodying → integrated.Briefly describe the posture each stage reflects in relation to my anchor verse.Present it in a way that preserves my agency to reflect and discern my own stage, with a pastoral tone throughout.Create a clear 7-stage continuum for my anchor verse from aspirational -&gt; integrated, grounded in its context.The stages are: aspirational -&gt; aware -&gt; stirred -&gt; resonating -&gt; practising -&gt; embodying -&gt; integrated.Briefly describe the posture each stage reflects in relation to my anchor verse.Present it in a way that preserves my agency to reflect and discern my own stage, with a pastoral tone throughout.Remember: this 7‑stage continuum is a way of naming postures, not a scorecard. Read it slowly and simply notice which descriptions feel close to home.🕵️ 2C. Human discernment (no AI) These stages are not scores. Your stage may change across seasons. You are the only person who can choose your stage. God meets us where we are.Take a pause. Read the continuum slowly.Reflect on 2 questions: What feels most true right now? What feels less true?Only after sitting with these, choose the stage that best describes your current posture. You may ask AI to clarify any stage descriptions, but don’t ask it to choose your stage for you – that part is yours.🗣️ 2D. Tell AI your stageOnce you’ve chosen your stage, tell AI: I think I’m at Stage X.I relate to this stage because [explain why].Please consider my self-assessment critically and help me reflect on it.I think I'm at Stage X.I relate to this stage because [explain why].Please consider my self-assessment critically and help me reflect on it.Let the AI’s response serve as a mirror for deeper reflection, not as a verdict. You can agree, disagree, or refine your sense of where you are as you go.Movement 3: Discern next stepGoal: Identify one gentle, realistic next step that helps you grow into your anchor verse more fully.Prompt AI: Based on the stage I’m at, what is one gentle, realistic next step I can achieve soon, that would help me grow into this verse more fully?Focus on formation, not performance. If possible, suggest a couple of options so I can choose what resonates best.Based on the stage I'm at, what is one gentle, realistic next step I can achieve soon, that would help me grow into this verse more fully?Focus on formation, not performance. If possible, suggest a couple of options so I can choose what resonates best.As you read the suggestions, hold them lightly. This step is about grace‑filled growth, not pressure. Notice what feels life‑giving, what feels realistic for your season and what aligns with the Spirit’s gentle nudge. You’re free to refine, adapt or simplify the step until it feels true to where you are.Reflection promptsTo help you process the experience, here are a few things you might reflect on after completing the activity.A. About the process What stood out most about using AI in a reflective or faith-shaped way? What felt natural, and what felt unfamiliar?B. About AI’s role Where did AI deepen your reflection? Where did you notice its limits?C. About discernment How did the guardrails help you stay grounded? What did you learn about your agency? How can you we hold AI-generated insights alongside the Holy Spirit’s guidance?These prompts reinforce the heart of the practice: learning to use AI reflectively, spiritually and wisely. Feel free to share any reflections in the comments below.Closing reflectionsThis practice isn’t about getting the ‘right’ answer. It’s about learning to engage AI with wisdom, agency and spiritual discernment.You’re free to revisit any movement whenever you need.Using this practice with other passagesThis activity isn’t limited to anchor verses. You can use the same structure to explore any passage you’re wrestling with or curious about.Keep the guardrails in place, and share your current understanding or struggle. Let the heart posture reflection, 7-stage continuum and next steps prompts guide you with clarity, nuance and agency. In Movement 1, by briefly name your current understanding or question about the passage. Then follow Movement 2 (heart posture + continuum) and Movement 3 (next steps) as usual.At its heart, this practice is about learning a new way of being with AI – one that keeps your agency intact, honours the Spirit’s work, and treats technology as a tool on the workbench rather than a source of authority.As you keep experimenting with this posture, you may find that AI can offer clarity in your reflection, but the real formation happens in the slow, Spirit‑led work of noticing, discerning and responding. May this become one more way you grow in wisdom, groundedness and grace as you live out the Scriptures that shape you. Under the hood, LLMs are basically giant predictive engines: layers of weights, probabilities and matrices learning how to guess the next most likely word based on the words you’ve already given them. It feels intelligent, but it’s just pattern‑matching at scale – very powerful, but not a mind. Maybe an Epic Maths Time post for another day :) &#8617; " }, { "title": "An algebraist’s field guide to constructing ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ, ℍ and 𝕆", "url": "/posts/algebraist-field-guide/", "categories": "Epic Maths Time, Just for Fun", "tags": "maths, uni-maths, algebra, ring-theory, frameworks, ai", "date": "2026-01-06 01:20:00 +1100", "snippet": "Mathematicians have constructed a small but diverse ecosystem of number systems, ranging from the integers (whole numbers) to the complex numbers and beyond.

Even long after university (and now through YouTube), this post arose from a recurring holy discontent I feel as someone with an algebraic background – a discontent that sounds roughly like this: Why did the Dedekind cut construction of the real numbers in analysis class make me want to cry? Aren’t we essentially just quotienting out null sequences from the Cauchy sequences? (Anyone else? No? Just me?) Why is everyone taking the rational numbers so much for granted? Why does everyone seem to love defining complex numbers as… ordered pairs of reals? Why don’t more people talk about the beautiful polynomial quotient construction of complex numbers? (Genuine question!) Isn’t everything just quotienting and universal properties at the end of the day? (Stopping before I have to start learning category theory.)With that in mind, we’ll walk through some standard ways of building the main number systems in this field guide – from the ring $\\mathbb{Z}$, through fields (haha) $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$, to the division algebras $\\mathbb{H}$ and $\\mathbb{O}$ – with a distinctive algebraic flavour, noting what each construction buys you and what it costs. Read this post at your level. The constructions are there if you want them – the mathematician opinions are there if you don’t. One attribution: this post benefited from conversations with an AI assistant who is very patient with algebraists.Along the way, we’ll pause to notice how different mathematicians tend to react as constructions are made and familiar rules begin to slip. Algebraists, analysts, geometers and category theorists value different kinds of structure, and tolerate different kinds of failure. We’ll keep a playful eye on these reactions as we go – with category theorists, as ever, remaining slightly off to one side. Let’s first meet the main characters.The main characters: 4 stereotypes of pure mathematiciansAlgebraistINTJ / ISTJ · ‘There is a correct abstraction, and I will find it.’Fields of study:Group, ring and field theory, algebraic number theory.What they love:Clean definitions, minimal constructions, quotients that feel inevitable, and objects characterised by what they are, not how they’re built. Deeply satisfied by constructions that work uniformly and don’t depend on arbitrary choices.What they dislike:Ad hoc definitions, unnecessary case distinctions, and proofs that devolve into epsilon–delta bookkeeping. Mildly suspicious of analysis, deeply suspicious of anything that works only ‘up to convergence’.Stereotype:Quietly rewriting your definition until it becomes canonical – and then pretending that was the plan all along.AnalystISTJ / ISFJ · ‘Does it converge?’Fields of study:Real and complex analysis, functional analysis, PDEs, measure theory.What they love:Limits, completeness, continuity, and constructions that guarantee good behaviour. Sequences that converge, functions that behave, and proofs that come with explicit control.What they dislike:Gaps, discontinuities, and definitions that don’t come with convergence guarantees. Uneasy around purely algebraic constructions until someone proves they’re complete.Stereotype:Nodding politely at your construction, then asking whether it’s complete.GeometerINFP / ENFP · ‘Can I draw it?’Fields of study:Differential geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, geometric group theory.What they love:Smoothness, symmetry, spatial intuition, and constructions that produce meaningful shapes and transformations. Objects that live naturally in space and do something interesting there.What they dislike:Pathological examples, excessive abstraction, and structures that stubbornly refuse to look like anything. Quietly resentful of counterexamples invented purely to cause trouble.Stereotype:Explaining something perfectly rigorous while gesturing vaguely in the air.Category theoristINTP · ‘This is really about the arrows.’Fields of study:Category theory, higher categories, topos theory.What they love:Universal properties, functoriality, and constructions that slot neatly into a broader framework. Deep satisfaction when many problems turn out to be the same problem. I don’t know what most of this means.What they dislike:Special cases, ad hoc definitions, and anything that doesn’t quite fit the vibe. Increasingly impatient with concrete models.Stereotype:Patiently waiting for everyone else to realise they were doing category theory all along.Building up: the simple pictureBefore we get technical, it helps to see why each new number system was invented in the first place. We start with the numbers we can count.The integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ – counting and directionThese are the numbers you get by counting forwards and backwards. They’re great for keeping score, measuring steps and talking about direction. But they’re rigid: you can’t divide freely, and there’s no notion of ‘in between’.So we add fractions. (We’ll answer how later.)The rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ – cutting things upRationals let us divide things evenly. You can share, average, and compare proportions. They’re dense – there’s always another rational between two others – but they’re still full of holes. Some lengths and limits just aren’t there.So we fill in the gaps. (We’ll answer how later.)The real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ – no missing pointsThe real numbers complete the line. Every limit you expect to exist does exist. You can do calculus, talk about continuity, and trust that zooming in forever won’t reveal a crack. This is where analysis feels at home.Then someone asks what happens if we solve equations that shouldn’t have solutions. (We’ll answer how later.)The complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ – turning sidewaysComplex numbers add a new direction. Suddenly every polynomial has roots, rotations become multiplication, and calculus becomes smoother and more powerful. What looked artificial at first turns out to be very natural.Then geometry gets ambitious. (We’ll answer how later.)The quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$ – rotations in spaceQuaternions give a clean way to describe rotations in three dimensions. You lose commutativity, but gain elegance and stability. They’re less about numbers on a line and more about how objects move.Finally, curiosity wins. (We’ll answer how later.)The octonions $\\mathbb{O}$ – what if we keep going?Octonions push the pattern one step further. You lose associativity, intuition, and most familiar tools – but gain deep connections to exceptional geometry and symmetry. This is where structure starts to fray.Now, let’s dive into the constructions, one number system at a time. Read the following sections (numbered 1 to 6) at your level. The constructions are there if you want them – the mathematician opinions are there if you don’t.1. The integers (ℤ)The natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = {0, 1, 2, \\ldots}$ are what we use to count. But, lacking negatives, we cannot solve equations like $x + 3 = 0$ within $\\mathbb{N}$. Solving this equation would require $x = -3$, which is not a natural number. This leads us to the integers, which are closed under addition and subtraction (as well as multiplication).In real life: This situation arises when we owe someone money. We can have \\$0 or a positive balance, but owing \\$3 means we’d have –\\$3.ℤː ConstructionGrothendieck group completion of the monoid $(\\mathbb{N}, +)$ of natural numbers.Formally: $\\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} / \\sim$, under the equivalence relation $(a,b) \\sim (c,d)$ if $a + d = b + c$. The resulting object is an abelian group under the operation on equivalence classes:\\[[(a,b)] + [(c,d)] = [(a + c, b + d)]\\]Intuition: Represent an integer as ‘a pile of counters minus another pile’.ℤː How mathematicians feel about it Algebraists: Deeply satisfied. This is the Platonic ideal of a construction – minimal, canonical and doing exactly one job perfectly. Analysts: ‘Sure, fine. Discrete scaffolding. Necessary, but only interesting insofar as it leads to limits.’ Geometers: ‘The fundamental group of a circle, but flattened and stripped of personality.’ (They appreciate it conceptually, but would rather be drawing something.) Category theorists: ‘Ah yes, the initial object in the category of rings. Everything begins here. Delicious.’2. The rationals (ℚ)The integers are closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication, but not division. We cannot solve equations like $3x = 2$ within $\\mathbb{Z}$. Solving this equation would require $x = 2/3$, which is not an integer. This leads us to the rational numbers, which are closed under division except for division by zero.In real life: This situation arises when we split things. Sharing 2 pizzas between 3 people would require each person to have 2/3 of a pizza.ℚ: ConstructionThere are 2 classic constructions:(2A) Equivalence classes of pairsDefine $\\mathbb{Q}$ as equivalence classes of pairs $(a,b)$ with $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, where $(a,b) \\sim (c,d)$ if $ad = bc$. Then define addition and multiplication by:\\[[(a,b)] + [(c,d)] = [(ad + bc, bd)]\\]\\[[(a,b)] \\cdot [(c,d)] = [(ac, bd)]\\]Then magically, every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse: $[(a,b)]^{-1} = [(b,a)]$ for $a \\neq 0$.Intuition: Represent a rational number as a fraction $(a/b)$, but formally as an equivalence class to handle different representations of the same number.(2B) Field of fractions$\\mathbb{Q}$ is the field of fractions of the integral domain $\\mathbb{Z}$.Formally, it is the universal field containing $\\mathbb{Z}$ such that every nonzero element of $\\mathbb{Z}$ becomes invertible.This construction emphasizes the universal property: any injective ring homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to a field factors uniquely through $\\mathbb{Q}$.ℚ: How mathematicians feel about it Algebraists: ‘A perfect localisation. Crisp. Clean. Canonical. Like a well-oiled machine that never jams.’ Field of fractions: ‘The gold standard. Everything works exactly as it should. Effortless, inevitable and deeply satisfying.’ Equivalence classes of pairs: ‘The classic fraction construction – concrete and serviceable, but clearly a model rather than the point.’ Analysts: ‘Finally, numbers I can put in a sequence without tripping over equivalence relations.’ Equivalence classes of pairs: ‘Feels like fractions you learned in school – concrete, familiar and numerically behaved.’ Field of fractions: ‘Abstract but useful – mainly appreciated for what it lets you embed into later.’ Geometers: ‘Points on a line, but only the ones with nice coordinates. Like a VIP guest list for the number line.’ Field of fractions: ‘The coordinate‑field viewpoint fits geometric intuition – smooth, structural and embedding‑friendly.’ Equivalence classes of pairs: ‘More combinatorial, less geometric – like trying to draw a line using bookkeeping.’ Category theorists: ‘The initial field containing $\\mathbb{Z}$. Also a localisation. Also a colimit. Also a vibe. Basically the Beyoncé of number constructions.’ Field of fractions: ‘Pure universal property. Everything factors. Everything commutes. Perfection.’ Equivalence classes of pairs: ‘A concrete presentation – fine, but why are we still talking about representatives?’ 3. The reals (ℝ)The rationals are a field: closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (except by zero). However, they are not complete. We cannot solve equations like $x^2 = 2$ within $\\mathbb{Q}$. Solving this equation would require $x = \\sqrt{2}$, which is not a rational number.This failure is not specific to $\\sqrt{2}$, nor even to algebraic numbers – roots of polynomials with integer coefficients. It reflects a deeper structural gap: $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not closed under limits. There are sequences in $\\mathbb{Q}$ that ought to converge but don’t in $\\mathbb{Q}$ – familiar examples include sequences converging to transcendental numbers such as $\\pi$ and $e$. Addressing this leads us to the real numbers, which form the unique complete ordered field.1In real life: This situation arises when we measure distances ‘as the crow flies’. If you walked 1 km east and then 1 km north, the straight-line distance back to your starting point is $\\sqrt{2}$ km – not a rational number.ℝ: ConstructionThere are 2 classic constructions:(3A) Dedekind cutsDownward-closed, nontrivial subsets of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with no greatest element, encoding a real number by everything less than it.Analysts love this because it smells like order completeness.(3B) Cauchy completion (the algebraic version!)Consider the ring $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\infty}$ of all sequences $(x_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ with $x_n \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.Define the subring $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{Q}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}^{\\infty}$ consisting of all Cauchy sequences, i.e. sequences $(x_n)$ such that for every $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists $N$ with $|x_m - x_n| &lt; \\varepsilon$ for all $m,n \\ge N$. These are sequences whose terms eventually become arbitrarily close to each other – that may or may not converge in $\\mathbb{Q}$.Inside $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{Q})$, define the ideal of null sequences:2\\[\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbb{Q}) = \\{ (x_n) \\in \\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{Q}) : x_n \\to 0 \\text{ as } n \\to \\infty \\}\\]The quotient ring $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{Q}) / \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbb{Q})$ is a field, which we identify with $\\mathbb{R}$.3 (The ideal $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbb{Q})$ is maximal in $\\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{Q})$, ensuring the quotient is a field.)A real number $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ corresponds to the equivalence class $(x_n) + \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbb{Q}) \\in \\mathcal{C}(\\mathbb{Q}) / \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbb{Q})$, where $x_n \\to x$ as $n \\to \\infty$. For example, one may take $x_n$ to be a rational approximation to $x$ accurate to $n$ decimal places.Intuition: We complete $\\mathbb{Q}$ by adding limits of Cauchy sequences, identifying sequences that differ by a null sequence.This construction blends algebraic structure with analytic completeness, capturing the essence of real numbers as limits of rational approximations. In other words: analysis isn’t scary when it knows what it’s trying to do. It just hands algebra the right inequality and steps aside.ℝ: How mathematicians feel about it Algebraists: Completion under a valuation. Very respectable. Quietly powerful. Preferences for algebraic numbers notwithstanding. Cauchy completion: The algebraic flavour appeals. Structure first – epsilons only when absolutely necessary. Dedekind cuts: Order‑theoretic and correct, but feels orthogonal to how algebra wants to think. Analysts: ‘Finally, limits exist.’ Dedekind cuts: Intuitive and order-based. Encodes the axiom of completeness directly via suprema. Cauchy completion (sequence version): Familiar and operational. Every Cauchy sequence converges – what more do you want? Cauchy completion (algebraic version): ‘Please don’t. I believe you – I just don’t want to see it. I don’t need quotients or ring language to know that limits exist.’ Geometers: ‘A complete line. Smooth. Continuous. Lovely.’ Dedekind cuts: The order structure feels geometric. But they just want a line they can draw. Cauchy completion: Algebraic but less geometric. But they just want a line they can draw. Category theorists: ‘The terminal Archimedean complete ordered field. Also a completion. Also a reflective subcategory.’ Walks away mysteriously. Cauchy completion: Completion and reflection are categorical wins. Dedekind cuts: Order‑theoretic, correct, but less universal‑property‑forward. 4. The complex numbers (ℂ)The real numbers are a complete field: closed under arithmetic operations, closed under limits. But we cannot solve equations like $x^2 = -1$ within $\\mathbb{R}$. Solving this equation would require $x = \\sqrt{-1}$, which is not a real number. This failure is about algebraic closure: certain polynomial equations simply have no real solutions. Addressing this leads us to the complex numbers.In real life: There is no real-life application of complex numbers (that is a joke). Complex numbers appear naturally in physics, engineering and signal processing.ℂ: ConstructionSeveral classic constructions give us the complex numbers, each illuminating a different aspect:(4A) Polynomial quotient (my favourite!)This is my favourite construction of the complex numbers, and it’s the reason I wrote this post in the first place – to hopefully raise awareness of the beauty of algebraic constructions through quotients.Consider the polynomial ring\\[\\mathbb{R}[x] = \\{a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\text{ and each } a_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\]Form the quotient by the maximal ideal generated by $x^2 + 1$, i.e., $\\mathbb{C} \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2 + 1)$.A complex number $z = a + bi \\in \\mathbb{C}$ corresponds to the equivalence class of the polynomial $a + bx$ modulo $x^2 + 1$, where $i$ is identified with $x$ modulo $x^2 + 1$ in the quotient. Arithmetic proceeds as usual, with the relation $x^2 = -1$ used to simplify expressions.This algebraic construction adds a root of the polynomial $x^2 + 1$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, producing the smallest field extension where this polynomial factors.Intuition: By forcing $x^2 + 1 = 0$, we create a new element $i$ with $i^2 = -1$, just like in high school. We don’t need to define any other rules – from this relation and properties of polynomial arithmetic, the other algebraic properties of $i$ and $\\mathbb{C}$ follow naturally. And that’s the beauty of this construction.This construction also generalises to other field extensions in a straightforward way, including finite fields. See this Michael Penn video for a great explanation and more detail on how to make new fields (but not a good place to stop reading this post). He notes that $\\mathbb{R}(i) = \\mathbb{C}$ is a basic example – and to me, this is the way to define the complex numbers.(4B) Ordered-pair modelRepresent complex numbers as pairs $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Define addition component-wise: $(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)$. Define multiplication by $(a, b)(c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc)$.This matches the polynomial quotient construction by identifying $(a, b)$ with $a + bi$, with the operations explicit in coordinates.(4C) Matrix modelIdentify $a + bi$ with the $2 \\times 2$ real matrix:\\[\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; -b \\\\ b &amp; a \\end{pmatrix} \\in M_2(\\mathbb{R})\\]Matrix addition and multiplication correspond to complex addition and multiplication. So $\\mathbb{C}$ embeds as a subring of $M_2(\\mathbb{R})$.Intuition: This model highlights the geometric interpretation of complex numbers as certain linear transformations (rotations and scalings) of the plane.(4D) Algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{R}$This is a non-constructive approach: we define $\\mathbb{C}$ as the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{R}$, meaning every non-constant polynomial with real coefficients factorises completely over $\\mathbb{C}$.This property makes $\\mathbb{C}$ algebraically complete and fundamental in algebra and analysis.ℂ: How mathematicians feel about it Algebraists: ‘A perfect quadratic extension, elegantly adding a root of $x^2 + 1$. The algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{R}$ is the ultimate prize.’ Polynomial quotient: ‘Elegant and algebraically satisfying – like a fine wine paired with a proof.’ Algebraic closure: ‘The grand finale – the algebraic party where every polynomial shows up.’ Ordered-pair model: ‘Concrete and familiar – like your favourite comfy chair.’ Matrix model: ‘Geometric and visual – the artsy cousin.’ Analysts: ‘Holomorphic functions are magic, and $\\mathbb{C}$ is where the magic works.’ Ordered-pair model: ‘Intuitive and analytic – like a warm bath for your brain.’ Matrix model: ‘Geometric insight – the scenic route.’ Polynomial quotient: ‘Algebraic but less direct – the backstage pass.’ Algebraic closure: ‘Abstract but powerful – the mysterious wizard.’ Geometers: ‘A plane with a built-in rotation operator, most naturally captured by matrices.’ Matrix model: ‘The geometric favourite – smooth moves on the dance floor.’ Ordered-pair model: ‘Concrete and visual – the reliable partner.’ Polynomial quotient: ‘Algebraic foundation – the sturdy shoes.’ Algebraic closure: ‘More abstract – the enigmatic stranger.’ Category theorists: ‘The algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{R}$. Also a $1$-dimensional complex vector space. Also a monoidal category if you squint.’ Algebraic closure: ‘Ultimate categorical object – the VIP of fields.’ Polynomial quotient: ‘Clear algebraic construction – the blueprint.’ Ordered-pair model: ‘Concrete but less categorical – the casual attendee.’ Matrix model: ‘Geometric but less categorical – the artsy outsider.’ 5. The quaternions (ℍ)We’re getting to a point where it’s getting harder to justify the existence of new number systems purely on structural grounds. William Rowan Hamilton attempted to extend the complex numbers to a 3-dimensional system, but found that multiplication could not be consistently defined in 3 dimensions while preserving the desired algebraic properties. Instead, he discovered a 4-dimensional system in 1843: the quaternions, a noncommutative but associative division algebra.Later in 1877, Ferdinand Georg Frobenius showed that the quaternions are one of only 3 associative division algebras over the reals (the others being $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$). This result was extended by Adolf Hurwitz, who classified normed division algebras, showing that the only normed division algebras over the reals are $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{C}$, $\\mathbb{H}$ and the octonions $\\mathbb{O}$.In real life: Quaternions are used in 3D computer graphics and robotics to represent rotations. A unit quaternion acts on 3‑dimensional space by conjugation, avoiding issues like gimbal lock that can occur with Euler angles.4 (I might write a separate post on this later.)ℍ: ConstructionTwo main approaches:(5A) Free associative algebra quotient Start with $\\mathbb{R}\\langle i, j \\rangle$, the free associative algebra on generators $i$ and $j$. Impose relations: $i^2 = j^2 = -1$, $ij = -ji$. Define $k = ij$.From the relation $k = ij$, the other quaternionic multiplication rules fall out naturally, such as\\[k^2 = (ij)(ij) = i(ji)j = -i^2j^2 = -(-1)(-1) = -1\\]as well as $jk = i$, $ki = j$, and the cyclic identities. We see that $\\mathbb{H}$ is noncommutative but associative.Equivalent presentation: $\\mathbb{H} \\cong \\mathbb{R}\\langle i,j \\rangle / (i^2 + 1, j^2 + 1, ji + ij) \\cong \\mathbb{C}\\langle j \\rangle / (j^2 + 1, ji + ij)$, where $i \\in \\mathbb{C}$.This can also be phrased as a $4$-dimensional real associative algebra with basis ${1, i, j, k}$ and the defining relations above.(5B) Cayley–Dickson doublingStart with $\\mathbb{C}$ and form $\\mathbb{H}$ as $\\mathbb{C}^2$ with twisted multiplication:\\[(a,b)(c,d) = (ac - d\\bar{b}, \\bar{a}d + cb)\\]where $\\bar{a}$ denotes complex conjugation.This doubling process also constructs $\\mathbb{C}$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ by the same formula, taking $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with twisted multiplication.The Cayley–Dickson construction produces a normed division algebra, doubling dimension at each step (at the expense of losing some algebraic properties like commutativity and then associativity).ℍ: How mathematicians feel about it Algebraists: ‘Noncommutative but associative. A respectable rebel.’ Free associative algebra quotient: ‘The classic, algebraically rich construction – like a jazz solo with rules.’ Cayley–Dickson doubling: ‘Elegant and recursive – the fractal of algebras.’ Analysts: ‘Unit quaternions give rotations. I like rotations.’ Cayley–Dickson doubling: ‘Connects nicely to complex numbers and rotations – smooth operator.’ Free associative algebra quotient: ‘More algebraic, less intuitive – the theory nerd.’ Geometers: ‘$SO(3)$ in disguise.’ Cayley–Dickson doubling: ‘Geometric and intuitive – the smooth dancer.’ Free associative algebra quotient: ‘Algebraic but less geometric – the bookworm.’ Category theorists: ‘A monoid object in real vector spaces with a braiding that mysteriously vanishes. Strange. Intriguing. Needs more diagrams.’ Free associative algebra quotient: ‘Clear algebraic presentation – the neat freak.’ Cayley–Dickson doubling: ‘Recursive but less categorical – the recursive thinker.’ 6. The octonions (𝕆)Yeah, I’m not even going to try to justify the octonions. They exist because they do. Discovered in 1843 by John T Graves, a friend of Hamilton, they fit into the beautiful pattern of normed division algebras over the reals classified by Hurwitz. But the buck stops here: there are no further normed division algebras beyond $\\mathbb{O}$.In real life: The octonions only exist because the algebraic pattern demands them. There is no compelling real‑life application.𝕆: ConstructionCayley–Dickson doubling applied to $\\mathbb{H}$. An 8-dimensional normed division algebra.Associativity is lost (this is genuinely a bit wild), but alternativity remains. In general, $(xy)z \\neq x(yz)$ for $x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{O}$. Yes, this means you now have to care about brackets. No, everyone is not okay with this.𝕆: How mathematicians feel about it Algebraists: ‘Nonassociative? Deep breaths. At least it’s alternative…’ Analysts: ‘The norm is multiplicative. I’m choosing to focus on that.’ Geometers: ‘$G_2$ lives here. Exotic, beautiful and slightly unsettling.’ Category theorists: ‘Nonassociative? Perfect. Structure is optional anyway.’Comparative ranking (leaning into the stereotypes)At this point, having exhausted all structural justifications, we turn to vibes. I’m going to rank the 6 number systems according to how much each mathematical tribe likes them, from most to least favourite.Algebraists $\\mathbb{Z}$ – Construction perfection. The simplest ring, the bedrock of algebraic dreams. It’s like the plain bagel of number systems: humble, essential, and infinitely versatile. $\\mathbb{Q}$ – Localisation bliss. Fractions done right, the algebraist’s Swiss Army knife. Elegant, canonical, and just complicated enough to feel grown-up. $\\mathbb{R}$ – A completion. Very tasteful. Like adding cream cheese to the bagel: smooth, refined, and absolutely necessary for analysis. $\\mathbb{C}$ – A quadratic extension. Clean. The algebraic upgrade that adds a dash of mystery and a pinch of magic. $\\mathbb{H}$ – Noncommutative but still associative. The rebellious teenager of algebras: breaking some rules but still playing by most. $\\mathbb{O}$ – ‘I mean… fine, but why?’ The wild card. Nonassociative, unsettling, but somehow still fascinating.Analysts $\\mathbb{R}$ – The One True Number System. Limits, continuity and all that jazz. The warm blanket of analysis. $\\mathbb{C}$ – Holomorphic functions are sorcery. The playground where magic happens and everything is beautifully smooth. $\\mathbb{Q}$ – Dense and countable. Like a well-organized library, but missing the comfy chairs and the heating. $\\mathbb{Z}$ – Endpoints of intervals. The rigid scaffolding that holds up the continuous world. $\\mathbb{H}$ – Rotations are neat. Handy for 3D spins, but a bit too algebraic for everyday analysis. $\\mathbb{O}$ – ‘I refuse to think about this.’ The analyst’s equivalent of a stress dream.Geometers $\\mathbb{R}$ – The line. The simplest, smoothest path. $\\mathbb{C}$ – The plane. Where geometry gets its groove on. $\\mathbb{H}$ – 3D rotations. The dance floor of spatial transformations. $\\mathbb{O}$ – $G_2$ and exotic spheres. The mysterious guest at the geometry party who somehow knows everyone. $\\mathbb{Q}$ – Rationals are too spiky. Like a cactus in a rose garden. $\\mathbb{Z}$ – A sad discretisation. The grid lines that remind you geometry isn’t always smooth.Category theorists $\\mathbb{Z}$ – Initial ring. A king. The universal starting point, the ruler of all rings. $\\mathbb{Q}$ – Localisation. A colimit. A dream. The construction everyone else was groping towards. $\\mathbb{R}$ – Reflective subcategory of ordered fields. The sophisticated adult in the room. $\\mathbb{C}$ – Algebraic closure. Terminal in spirit. The categorical VIP. $\\mathbb{O}$ – Nonassociativity is a feature. Finally, something that behaves like they secretly want. $\\mathbb{H}$ – ‘Too associative. Needs more coherence laws.’ The overachiever who just can’t relax.This post captures the constructions of various number systems and the personalities they attract. The number systems form a ladder of increasing algebraic chaos, and each mathematical tribe has its own favourite rung.Thank you for reading this far. Whether you skimmed the constructions or lingered over them, I’m glad you were here. If you have a favourite construction, a different ranking, a proof you want to share or would like to see, or even a strong reaction to any of this, please share it in a comment below :) The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\{a + b\\sqrt{2} : a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}$ does contain $\\sqrt{2}$, but it is still not complete. In fact, adding every real algebraic number to $\\mathbb{Q}$ still results in a field that is not complete. Completeness is about closing the field under limits: every Cauchy sequence must converge. &#8617; An ideal is a special subset of a ring, itself closed under addition and ‘absorbs’ multiplication by any element of the ring. Ideals allow us to form quotient rings, which generalise the idea of modular arithmetic. &#8617; A quotient ring $R/I$ formalises the idea of collapsing algebraic structure. It is formed by taking $R$ and considering equivalence classes based on the ideal $I$. Two elements $a,b \\in R$ are collapsed to a point if their difference $a - b$ lies in $I$. The operations of addition and multiplication are defined on these equivalence classes in a way that respects the original operations in $R$. &#8617; A 3D rotation by a unit quaternion $q \\in S^3$ acts on a vector $v \\in \\operatorname{Im}(\\mathbb{H}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}^3$ via the map $v \\mapsto qvq^{-1}$. &#8617; " }, { "title": "TESMD: a mathematical framework for worship song analysis", "url": "/posts/TESMD-framework-worship-song-analysis/", "categories": "Transformed by Grace, Harmonic Theology", "tags": "worship, theology, maths, music, frameworks, geometry, ai, essay", "date": "2026-01-03 01:30:00 +1100", "snippet": "Dear reader… I’m excited that this blog is back after a 3-year pause.

Formerly Epic Maths Time, it’s now called Forms and Formation: a space for me to share some new reflections about faith, music and mathematics – formed by structure, shaped by grace.Same brain, new name. I’m still guided by my algebraic roots, inclined towards structure and patterns. I’m calling this new direction harmonic theology: part musical, part mathematical, fully faithful, and (hopefully) attentive to the deeper patterns that hold things together.Harmonic theology is an intentional bridge between music, mathematics, and theology – drawing on the depth and power of all 3 fields. It brings together lyrical and musical analysis with the tools of algebra, geometry, analysis and statistics, all grounded in theology. The aim is attentiveness to the deeper patterns that shape worship and formation.Over the 2025–2026 New Year, I was busy – but a different sort of busy. Busy creating my new TESMD (theological–emotional–spiritual–musical–dispositional) model: a 5‑axis geometric model for mapping worship songs across dimensions, expressed on a $[-5, +5]$ integer scale. What follows includes: full definitions conceptual grounding mathematical notes lexical spines detailed examples from SEVEN and EIGHT by Brooke Ligertwood (2 of my favourite worship albums) what this all reveals about worship that speaks to me an invitation to try TESMD yourself using AI.I’ll admit upfront that TESMD is a slightly ridiculous thing to build. But it grew out of a genuine need for language – a way of making sense of how I experience worship, why certain songs shape me differently over time, and how patterns begin to emerge when you stop looking at songs in isolation.This work was shaped through prayerful reflection and iterative dialogue, with Microsoft Copilot AI used as a tool for refinement, structure and analytical clarity. I’ve done this intentionally – as an example of how artificial intelligence, when used humbly and discerningly, can assist spiritual formation, serving the work of theology rather than usurping it.1. TESMD model (full definition and notation)TESMD (pronounced /ˈtɛz.məd/) is a 5‑axis coordinate system describing the theological, emotional, spiritual, musical, and dispositional character of a worship song.A song is represented as:\\[(T, E, S, M, D) \\in [-5, +5]^5\\]Each axis is an independent interval from –5 to +5.A note on judgement (or rather, the lack of it) The TESMD axes are designed to offer shared language for noticing patterns in worship songs. They help surface where emphasis, movement, and formation are taking place across different dimensions, without collapsing those observations into scores or verdicts. The focus is on description and orientation – on seeing more clearly what is present and how it functions.T – Theological altitude (Incarnation ↔ Majesty)What it measures: The vertical orientation of a song’s theology – whether it emphasises God’s nearness and shared humanity (low Christology), or God’s transcendence and eternal reign (high Christology). –5 = incarnational focus: nearness, humanity, suffering, weakness, Jesus‑with‑us 0 = present‑tense immanence: God‑with‑us‑now, lived faith, present victory +5 = cosmic majesty: throne‑room imagery, eschatology, transcendence, eternal reignE – Emotional posture (Intimate ↔ Proclamation)What it measures: The posture and force of emotional expression – whether the song speaks inwardly and personally, or outwardly with declarative weight. –5 = intimate and vulnerable: personal address, exposed before God, devotional honesty 0 = blended posture: shared story or reflection within a corporate frame +5 = proclamatory: weight‑bearing corporate declaration, announcing spiritual reality with convictionS – Spiritual posture (Reverent ↔ Celebratory)What it measures: The affective weight of the song’s spirituality – whether spiritual expression is contained and weight‑bearing, or released and expressive. –5 = reverent and weighty: awe‑filled, contemplative, holy, hushed 0 = balanced warmth: sincere, grounded, neither sombre nor exuberant +5 = celebratory and triumphant: joyful, victorious, exuberant, praise‑drivenM – Musical energy (Still ↔ Energetic)What it measures: The kinetic intensity of the music – how much physical and rhythmic motion it invites. –5 = still and spacious: slow, minimal, contemplative, silence‑friendly 0 = moderate motion: groove‑based, mid‑tempo, steady momentum +5 = high‑energy and explosive: driving, anthemic, festival‑likeD – Dispositional focus (Deep ↔ Immediate)What it measures: The mode of engagement the song requires – whether meaning is inhabited through inward reflection, or received immediately with minimal cognitive or emotional processing. –5 = excavative: meaning not supplied, constructed through inward reflection 0 = balanced engagement: clear meaning, invites reflection without demand +5 = immediate and accessible: pre‑formed meaning, low processing load, sing‑along easeCanonical orientationAll TESMD axes are oriented toward expansion – movement from interior or constrained states toward openness, immediacy, or transcendence. T+ → transcendence E+ → outward declaration S+ → outward joy M+ → outward movement D+ → immediate accessibilityThis shared orientation keeps the model intuitive and internally consistent: positive movement always corresponds to greater openness, reach, or immediacy, never to moral or qualitative superiority.2. Context, motivation, development, mathematical structureContextTESMD was developed to describe worship songs with greater precision than common shorthand labels such as ‘slow’, ‘intimate’, or ‘majestic’. These descriptors collapse multiple dimensions into a single impression and obscure important distinctions.The goal was to create a model that captures theological, emotional, spiritual, musical and dispositional dimensions independently, allowing songs to be described accurately without conflation. Shared language allows worship leaders and communities to talk about difference without turning preference into judgement.A grounding note (thanks to the Men’s Theology group from my church, FGAM): Worship is fundamentally about God, and Christlikeness is formed through the doing of worship – obedience, surrender, devotion, participation – rather than through environment or aesthetic alone. Frameworks like TESMD simply help us notice the patterns of formation we’re already participating in.A note on application over time (sets and trajectories) While the examples here focus on individual songs, one of the most interesting ways to use TESMD is at the level of worship sets and how they unfold over time. Looking at sequences of songs can help surface movement, balance, and formation across a service – or across months and years. This makes it easier to notice the theological and emotional journeys we’re inviting congregations into. And, as Iain from my church pointed out, this kind of pattern‑spotting doesn’t stop at one church or context – it opens up ways of noticing how worship takes shape across communities around the world.The next sections explore the motivation, development, and some mathematical structure behind TESMD. If you’d rather see it in action, you can skip ahead to the practical examples.MotivationTESMD aims to be: orthogonal – each axis describes a distinct domain minimal – no redundant or overlapping dimensions continuous – values vary smoothly rather than categorically intuitive – usable by musicians, worship leaders, and pastors mathematically clean – supports comparison, clustering, and analysis.It separates things people often conflate: reverence vs low energy intimacy vs incarnation celebration vs energy theology vs emotion depth vs accessibility.Development process Began with a single emotional axis (‘heart vs mind’), which became emotional posture (E) Introduced theological altitude (T) as an independent dimension Split tonal affect from kinetic intensity, yielding spiritual posture (S) and musical energy (M) Identified the need for a depth/accessibility dimension, formalised as dispositional focus (D) Tested alternative candidate axes (e.g. acoustic/band, soaring/grounded) and demonstrated that they collapse into combinations of S and M Verified conceptual orthogonality: each axis describes a different domain of experience Normalised the framework to a 5‑axis hypercube Rescaled all axes to $[–5, +5]$ for human‑friendly communication and practical useMathematical considerationsStructureTESMD is a 5‑dimensional closed hypercube:\\[[-5, +5]^5\\]Each song is represented as a point:\\[(T, E, S, M, D)\\]TESMD is a metric subspace of a normed vector space, but not itself treated as a vector space. While the ambient space admits addition and scalar multiplication, these operations are not semantically meaningful for songs. Distance, however, is meaningful.MetricGiven 2 songs $a$ and $b$:\\(a = (T_a, E_a, S_a, M_a, D_a)\\)\\[b = (T_b, E_b, S_b, M_b, D_b)\\]Default metric: Euclidean (L²)\\[d_2(a, b) = \\sqrt{(T_a - T_b)^2 + (E_a - E_b)^2 + (S_a - S_b)^2 + (M_a - M_b)^2 + (D_a - D_b)^2}\\]This allows: similarity measurement clustering and neighbourhood analysis centroid computation for albums, artists, or worship movements geometric visualisation and projection.Note: A cluster is a disjoint subset of songs that are mutually close under the metric, formed at a low percentile threshold reflecting strong internal coherence. The threshold may be slightly expanded to include clearly aligned songs, provided the group remains tight relative to the collection as a whole and no loosely related tracks are pulled in.Alternative metric: Taxicab (L¹)\\[d_1(a, b) = |T_a - T_b| + |E_a - E_b| + |S_a - S_b| + |M_a - M_b| + |D_a - D_b|\\] Treats each axis as an independent contribution Useful when cumulative difference matters more than geometric proximityAlternative metric: Chebyshev (L^∞)\\[d_\\infty(a, b) = \\max\\{|T_a - T_b|, |E_a - E_b|, |S_a - S_b|, |M_a - M_b|, |D_a - D_b|\\}\\] Measures the largest single‑axis difference Highlights dominant contrastsThe choice of metric does not change the underlying space, only the interpretation of distance within it.OrthogonalityThe axes are conceptually orthogonal: each describes a distinct domain of experience.Empirically, mild correlations may appear (e.g. celebratory songs often exhibit higher musical energy), but these do not collapse the dimensions. Orthogonality here is semantic, not probabilistic.Transformations and morphismsThe TESMD space admits clipped diagonal affine transformations acting on individual axes or subsets of axes. These model meaningful changes such as: stylistic shifts arrangement changes contextual reinterpretation cultural or liturgical translation.Formally, these are morphisms of the ambient normed space, composed with projection back into the closed hypercube $[-5, +5]^5$. They preserve semantic structure while allowing controlled movement.3. TESMD examples – Brooke Ligertwood’s SEVEN and EIGHTA quick word on subjectivity: The examples here aren’t meant to claim objectivity so much as coherence. They were stress‑tested over time, and more than once a judgement I wasn’t happy with forced me back to the drawing board – redefining an axis, refining its range or even adding a new one. In that sense, the examples didn’t just apply the model: they helped form it.These examples are grounded in the TESMD lexical spines, which formalise the descriptive language used here. The spines are introduced in the following section. You may find it helpful to return to them when seeing the framework in use.SEVEN – ‘Majesty on Earth’ Song T E S M D Lexical spines Ancient Gates +4 +4 +4 +4 +2 Majestic · Proclamatory · Exultant · Anthemic · Pre‑digested Banner +3 +3 +3 +3 +2 Sovereign · Exhortational · Triumphant · Driving · Pre‑digested A Thousand Hallelujahs ❤️ +4 +2 +4 +3 +2 Majestic · Declarative · Exultant · Driving · Pre‑digested Communion −5 −1 −3 +2 −1 Cruciform · Corporate‑prayer · Kenotic · Soaring · Engaged Nineveh ❤️ −2 −3 −4 −2 −4 Covenantal · Prayerful · Contemplative · Gentle · Interior Burn ❤️ +1 −3 −3 +1 −3 Exalted · Prayerful · Kenotic · Lifted · Reflective Honey in the Rock −2 0 +2 +3 +4 Covenantal · Testimonial · Joyful · Driving · Instinctive I Belong to Jesus ❤️ −3 −2 −1 +1 +1 Relational · Confessional · Assured · Lifted · Direct King Jesus ❤️ +5 +4 +4 +4 +2 Eschatological · Proclamatory · Exultant · Anthemic · Pre‑digested Centroid: \\((T = +0.56,\\ E = +0.44,\\ S = +0.67,\\ M = +2.11,\\ D = +0.56)\\) Exalted T · Lightly Proclamatory E · Grateful‑leaning S · Soaring M · Slightly Direct DSummary blurb:SEVEN gathers songs of corporate exaltation and Christ‑centred confidence, positioning the Church upright beneath the majesty of God. Its theological altitude leans toward kingship and glory, pairing strong declarative praise with moments of confession and repentance that keep exaltation grounded.Musically, the album sustains a processional energy – lifted and expansive – while joy remains reverent rather than exuberant. Dispositional focus ranges from instinctive corporate participation to slower interior reckoning, most notably in Nineveh and Burn. Together, these songs raise the gaze of the gathered body, anchoring praise in shared confession, authority, and glory.Key themes: Christ exalted and reigning Corporate identity and declaration Confidence without emotional excess Glory expressed through order, strength, and restraintAlbum statistics (Euclidean distance): Diameter: Communion ↔ King Jesus (d = 13.67) Closest pair: Ancient Gates ↔ King Jesus (d = 1.00)Cluster structure: Majestic / proclamatory crown (d ≤ 3.0) Ancient Gates · A Thousand Hallelujahs · King Jesus · Banner Centroid: $(T = +4.00, E = +3.25, S = +3.75, M = +3.50, D = +2.00)$ Interior / repentant formation (d ≤ 5.0) Nineveh · Burn · I Belong to Jesus Centroid: $(T = −1.33, E = −2.67, S = −2.67, M = 0.00, D = −2.00)$ Statistics quick read: The collection’s diameter captures the full span of SEVEN: from cruciform sacramental depth (Communion) to expansive proclamatory exaltation (King Jesus). The proclamatory core is extremely tight: Ancient Gates and King Jesus merge first, with A Thousand Hallelujahs close behind and Banner joining as a slightly looser extension, forming a compact cluster centred on kingship, authority, and declarative praise. An interior–repentant formation cluster follows, with Nineveh and Burn cohering first and I Belong to Jesus joining shortly after, forming a prayer‑shaped grouping marked by surrender and inward formation. Honey in the Rock remains unclustered as a joyful testimonial outlier, while Communion stands apart as a sacramental and cruciform singularity.

Unlike SEVEN, which stands squarely in corporate exaltation, this album walks the long road between cross and kingdom – moving fluidly between interior prayer and outward declaration.Reverence and motion are held together: surrender is embodied rather than static, and praise emerges from formation rather than momentum. The album’s dispositional centre is clarity without flattening – meaning is accessible, but never rushed. Faith here is shaped over time, marked less by triumphal urgency than by trustful perseverance, grounded in the cross and oriented toward the coming King.Key themes: The cross as a formative pathway Obedience and repentance as sustained posture Hope shaped by patience, affection, and trust Authority encountered through submission and faithfulnessAlbum statistics (Euclidean distance): Diameter: Calvary’s Enough ↔ King of Kings (d = 13.67) Closest pair: Fear of God ↔ Authority (d = 1.00)Cluster structure: Proclamatory / kingship (d ≤ 2.0) Fear of God · Authority · King of Kings Centroid: $(T = +4.33, E = +4.00, S = +3.33, M = +4.00, D = +2.00)$ Testimonial / warm praise (d ≤ 2.5) Desert Song · Bless God / Every Chance I Get Centroid: $(T = −1.50, E = +2.50, S = +2.00, M = +3.00, D = +2.00)$ Devotional / formational prayer (d ≤ 4.0) Lead Me to the Cross · I Will Exalt You · Like Incense / Sometimes by Step Centroid: $(T = −3.33, E = −3.33, S = −2.33, M = +2.67, D = −1.33)$ Statistics quick read: The album’s diameter captures the full span of EIGHT: from deep cruciform stillness (Calvary’s Enough) to expansive eschatological exaltation (King of Kings). The proclamatory core is extremely tight: Fear of God and Authority merge first, with King of Kings joining at a very low threshold, forming a compact cluster centred on kingship, authority, and proclamatory praise. A resilient confidence pair forms at a moderate distance, linking Desert Song and Bless God / Every Chance I Get around lived trust, forward motion, and steady musical drive. A devotional–formational prayer cluster emerges through mutual closeness between Lead Me to the Cross, I Will Exalt You, and Like Incense / Sometimes by Step, forming a reflective grouping marked by surrender, affection, and interior formation. Calvary’s Enough remains unclustered as a cruciform singularity, while Soon stands apart as a devotional eschatological outlier. What TESMD says about worship that speaks to meLooking at the songs I’ve hearted across SEVEN and EIGHT, a pretty clear TESMD shape starts to emerge. I’m drawn to the low-posture end – songs with T–, E–, S– and D– coordinates that lean incarnational, prayerful, and confessional. These are songs like Nineveh, Lead Me to the Cross, Calvary’s Enough, Like Incense and I Will Exalt You – songs that sit close to the ground, name weakness honestly and invite waiting. They tend to carry emotional weight without needing musical lift, and they form me by making space for presence.At the same time, I have a deep affection for the big T+ moments – the cosmic, eschatological, ‘King Jesus reigns’ songs that stretch the imagination upward and outward. King Jesus is the full-throated apex, but A Thousand Hallelujahs sits surprisingly close: high T, S and M, still warm in E, still outward in D. And then there’s Soon, which carries T+ not as triumph but as E– devotional longing – eschatological hope held in tension. Apparently, my worship instincts live in that space: low and lifted, cross and crown, intimacy and immensity. I like worship that knows how to kneel – and when to look up.4.

Try it yourself – using TESMD with AIIf you’re curious to try this yourself, TESMD works just as well on your own playlists – helping you explore patterns across a collection and reflect on the kinds of worship postures they tend to invite over time. If you drop the TESMD AI guide into an AI chat, it will: ask what you want to analyse (a song, album, or playlist) prompt you to supply lyrics in a clear format describe how the songs are oriented across the TESMD axes using evidence from the lyrics invite discussion about what feels right or wrong treat the analysis as provisional and open to refinement apply simple geometric tools (optional) – such as distance, centroids, or clustering – to explore patterns across a collection.You can download the TESMD AI guide as a plain text file here: download the TESMD AI guide.

I’m honoured that my supervisors (and apparently the examiners too haha) were pleased with the result, and I’m humbled that my effort this year has led to graduating with first class honours — I owe it all to those who were there for me: my family, friends (especially my honours friends, church friends, Chris, and Wes), and God, whose love and presence sustained me through the busy times.My research was in minimum bases for permutation groups. A permutation group is, loosely speaking, a collection of permutations of a set (essentially rearrangements of the set) which, when applied in succession, remains in the collection; the reverse permutation must also be in the collection, as well as the identity (do nothing) permutation. A base is a collection of points in the set being permuted, such that if a permutation in the collection fixes every point in the base, then that permutation must be the identity.My goal was to talk about what is known about the smallest possible size of a base of a given permutation group, with use of the GAP computational language, and with original instructive examples interwoven throughout. I hope you find it interesting (or at least a pleasant read, which was definitely a focus and pride of mine) — and if you’re into group theory or maths in general, then I hope it may inspire you in your own work in some way. (You may want to watch the video below first, as it may clarify some basic content here in the thesis.)Below is a recording of my final honours presentation. I motivated my research using the Rubik’s group (permutations of the Rubik’s cube), which is one of the many applications of permutation groups, and one that is close to my heart (thanks Wes). I tried to make it fun and engaging with the Rubik’s cube example, and a bit more understandable for a wider audience — I hope you will find it as interesting as I did!While I might not be doing as much maths in the future, I hope to continue to review and share some more interesting things I’ve learnt along my mathematical journey. Despite going into full-time work not directly related to my field of study, my honours year was by no means a waste of time, and I am eternally grateful for this opportunity to spend 2022 studying something I’m passionate about.

This leads us to Newton’s generalised binomial theorem, involving the binomial series:Theorem 1 (binomial theorem). If \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), then\\[(1 + x)^\\alpha = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\binom{\\alpha}{n} x^n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\binom{\\alpha}{n}\\right)_n;\\]this is an equality in the formal sense, where we don’t care about convergence. (Note that the series converges when \\(\\lvert x\\rvert &lt; 1\\) in the analytic sense.)What exactly does \\(\\binom{\\alpha}{n}\\) mean for \\(\\alpha \\not\\in \\mathbb{N}\\)? The factorials are no longer well-defined (even if we consider the Gamma function \\(\\Gamma\\) where \\(\\Gamma(n) = (n - 1)!\\) and enforce that \\(\\alpha! = \\Gamma(\\alpha + 1)\\), this still fails for negative integers since \\(\\Gamma\\) is not defined there); so we instead use this definition:Definition 1. The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{\\alpha}{n}\\), where \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), is defined by\\[\\binom{\\alpha}{n} := \\frac{\\overbrace{\\alpha(\\alpha - 1)(\\alpha - 2)\\dotsb(\\alpha - n + 1)}^{n\\ \\text{terms}}}{n!}.\\]In the case that \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), this obviously agrees with the usual definition, as noted above. Let’s prove the binomial theorem using generating functions! The proof turns out to be quite interesting, and involves solving a differential equation!A generatingfunctionological proof of the binomial theoremFix \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and let \\(A \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\binom{\\alpha}{n}\\right)_n\\); this is the generating function of the binomial coefficients. Note that when \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), these terms eventually become 0, but usually we get infinitely many nonzero terms. Our goal is to show that \\(A = (1 + x)^\\alpha\\).Note that\\[\\frac{\\binom{\\alpha}{n}}{\\binom{\\alpha}{n + 1}} = \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha - 1)\\dotsb(\\alpha - n + 1)}{\\alpha(\\alpha - 1)\\dotsb(\\alpha - n + 1)(\\alpha - n)} \\frac{(n + 1)!}{n!} = \\frac{n + 1}{\\alpha - n} \\implies (n + 1)\\binom{\\alpha}{n + 1} = (\\alpha - n)\\binom{\\alpha}{n};\\]this is a recurrence for the binomial coefficients that holds for \\(n \\geq 0\\), with \\(\\binom{\\alpha}{0} = \\frac{1}{0!} = 1\\), since 1 is the empty product.Now recall that if \\(A \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (a_n)\\), then \\(DA \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} ((n + 1)a_{n + 1})\\); this is precisely the left hand side of our recurrence! In summary, and using rule 2 (on polynomials), we see\\[\\left((n + 1)\\binom{\\alpha}{n + 1}\\right)_n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} DA \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left((\\alpha - n)\\binom{\\alpha}{n}\\right)_n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (\\alpha - xD)A.\\]So \\(DA = (\\alpha - xD)A \\implies (1 + x)DA = \\alpha A\\). This is a differential equation that the generating function for the binomial coefficients satisfy! We can use the theory of differential equations, in particular the integrating factor method (this is a first order linear ODE), to write this as\\[\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + x}\\right)^\\alpha DA - \\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + x}\\right)^{\\alpha + 1} A = 0\\]and observe that this gives\\[D\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + x}\\right)^\\alpha A\\right) = 0 \\implies \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + x}\\right)^\\alpha A = 1\\]where we use the initial condition \\(A(0) = \\binom{\\alpha}{0} = 1\\). Then rearranging, we see that\\[A = \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + x}\\right)^{-\\alpha} = (1 + x)^\\alpha,\\]and we are done – we have proved that\\[(1 + x)^\\alpha = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\binom{\\alpha}{n} x^n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\binom{\\alpha}{n}\\right)_n!\\]Applying the binomial theorem to the Catalan numbersRecall from the last post that Catalan numbers count, for instance, the number of ways to have a balanced string of parentheses of length \\(2n\\), e.g. something like (()(()))(()), but not ())((()). Then it turns out that \\(C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n}\\), and their generating function is\\[C = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x}.\\]Let’s use the binomial theorem with \\(\\alpha = 1/2\\), to recover the general formula for \\(C_n\\). This is useful, because for instance in the balanced parentheses problem, we can use a combinatorial argument to show that the generating function is \\(C\\), but a priori, we don’t know an explicit formula for \\(C_n\\) (or some similar problem).First recognise that\\[-C = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - 4x} - 1}{2x} = \\frac{1}{x}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right);\\]by the binomial theorem,\\[\\sqrt{1 - 4x} = (1 - 4x)^{1/2} = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\binom{1/2}{n} (-4x)^n = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\binom{1/2}{n} (-4)^n x^n\\]where \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{1/2}{0}(-4)^0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\), so we recognise\\[-C \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{1/2}{n + 1}(-4)^{n + 1}\\right) \\implies C \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\binom{1/2}{n + 1}(-1)^n 2^{2n + 1}\\right)\\]using rule 1 (with \\(m = 1\\)). Then it remains to check\\[\\begin{align*}C_n = [x^n]C &amp;= \\binom{1/2}{n + 1}(-1)^n 2^{2n + 1} = \\frac{\\overbrace{(1/2)(-1/2)(-3/2)\\dotsb(-(2n-1)/2)}^{n\\ \\text{terms}}}{(n + 1)!}(-1)^n 2^{2n + 1} \\\\&amp;= \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\dotsb (2n - 1)}{2^{n + 1} \\cdot (n + 1)!}2^{2n + 1} = \\underbrace{\\frac{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\dotsb 2n}{2^n \\cdot n!}}_{= 1} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\dotsb (2n - 1)}{(n + 1)!} 2^n \\\\&amp;= \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\cdot \\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2} = \\frac{1}{n + 1}\\binom{2n}{n},\\end{align*}\\]which is the claimed formula for the Catalan numbers!

Verify that the above two formulas for geometric and arithmetic sequences hold, using a proof by induction or similar approach.In this post, I will introduce a totally overkill approach of deriving these two formulas; this approach will turn out to be a general approach to solving many recurrence relations. The key to this approach is to use generating functions.A “naive” approach for geometric sequencesStarting with \\(a_{n + 1} = ra_n\\), multiply by \\(x^n\\) and sum over all \\(n \\geq 0\\) (for which this recurrence is valid for) to get\\[\\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_{n + 1}x^n = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} ra_n x^n = r \\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_n x^n.\\]If we let \\(A(x) = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_n x^n\\), then surely\\[\\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_{n + 1}x^n = \\sum_{n \\geq 1} a_nx^{n - 1} = \\frac{1}{x} \\sum_{n \\geq 1} a_nx^n = \\frac{1}{x} \\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_nx^n - a_0\\right) = \\frac{1}{x}(A(x) - a_0),\\]so we get the equation\\[\\frac{1}{x}(A(x) - a_0) = rA(x) \\implies A(x) = \\frac{a_0}{1 - rx} = a_0 \\sum_{n \\geq 0} (rx)^n = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_0 r^n x^n.\\]But recall that \\(A(x) = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_n x^n\\), so we must surely have \\(a_n = a_0 r^n\\), which agrees with the known formula!So we solved the recurrence relation by using some sort of magical overkill power series approach. How exactly does it work, can we be more methodical, and is it even useful? I will attempt to answer that in the rest of this post.Generating functionsUnless otherwise stated, all sequences \\((a_n)_{n \\geq 0} = (a_0,a_1,\\dotsc)\\) start with a zeroth term \\(a_0\\); I simply write \\((a_n)\\).Definition 1. Consider a sequence \\((a_n)\\). The (ordinary) generating function of \\((a_n)\\) is the (formal) power series\\[A = \\sum_{n \\geq 0}a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\dotsb\\]where the coefficient of \\(x^n\\), denoted \\([x^n]A\\), is precisely \\(a_n\\). We write \\((a_n) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} A\\).These power series are formal in the sense that we do not care about convergence: they are not analytic. In general, the \\(x\\) is to be interpreted as an indeterminate; a symbol that can be manipulated, but does not have meaning on its own. Representing a sequence in this way serves as to ensure that the terms in the sequence remain “separated” – they are separated by powers of \\(x\\).The ring of formal power seriesEvery formal power series is associated with a unique sequence – its sequence of coefficients – and vice versa. Two formal power series are equal if and only if the sequences of coefficients are equal.The set of formal power series forms a ring \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) in a natural way (where the coefficients are in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)); the addition is given by\\[\\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0}a_n x^n\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0}b_n x^n\\right) = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} (a_n + b_n)x^n,\\]and the (commutative) multiplication is given by\\[\\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0}a_n x^n\\right)\\left(\\sum_{n \\geq 0}b_n x^n\\right) = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\left(\\sum_{k = 0}^n a_k b_{n - k}\\right)x^n;\\]this looks funny but it’s what we would expect when we try to multiply out an (infinite) expression of the form\\[(a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\dotsb)(b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \\dotsb) = a_0b_0 + (a_0b_1 + a_1b_0)x + (a_0b_2 + a_1b_1 + a_2b_0)x^2 + \\dotsb\\]which it precisely is. The additive identity (zero) in \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) is the power series \\(0 = 0 + 0x + 0x^2 + \\dotsb \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (0)\\). The multiplicative identity (unit) in \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) is the power series \\(1 = 1 + 0x + 0x^2 + \\dotsb \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (1,0,0,\\dotsc)\\).For example, the (multiplicative) inverse of the power series \\(1 - x = 1 - x + 0x^2 + 0x^3 + \\dotsb\\) turns out to be \\(\\sum_{n \\geq 0}x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + \\dotsb\\); we can verify this by computing\\[(1 - x)(1 + x + x^2 + \\dotsb) = 1 + (1 - 1)x + (1 - 1 + 0)x^2 + \\dotsb = 1.\\]So it is reasonable to write that\\[\\frac{1}{1 - x} = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + \\dotsb;\\]this is true in the formal sense, not just for \\(\\lvert x\\rvert &lt; 1\\) as in the analytical case. However, when the power series in the analytical sense converges, it is reasonable to substitute in numerical values for \\(x\\). This also gives us our first (simple) result:Lemma 1. Let \\((1) = (1,1,\\dotsc)\\) be the constant sequence; then\\[\\frac{1}{1 - x} \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (1).\\]Note that extracting coefficients from power series is somehow “linear”, in the sense that \\([x^n](A + kB) = [x^n]A + k[x^n]B\\) (the formal power series also form a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), and this is a linear map (functional) \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]] \\to \\mathbb{R}\\)). This is a useful fact that we use later.Solving recurrences – a generatingfunctionological approachThroughout this section, let \\((a_n) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} A\\). A generatingfunctionological approach, as coined in Wilf’s book “generatingfunctionology”, is an approach to working with sequences using their generating functions.Definition 2. Let \\((a_n)\\) be a sequence. Then a (\\(k\\)th order) recurrence for \\((a_n)\\) is an equation \\(\\varphi(n,a_n,a_{n + 1},\\dotsc,a_{n + k}) = 0\\) which holds for particular \\(n\\).If we fix a value of \\(n\\), then a recurrence gives us one equation that \\((a_n)\\) satisfies. However, the expression\\[\\sum_n \\varphi(n,a_n,a_{n + 1},\\dotsc,a_{n + k})x^n = 0\\]simultaneously encodes every equation that \\((a_n)\\) satisfies that is given by the recurrence. In the (usual) case that \\(n\\) ranges over \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we recover the generating function of \\((a_n)\\); otherwise observe for instance that \\(\\sum_{n \\geq N} a_n x^n = A - a_0 - a_1x - \\dotsb - a_{N - 1}x^{N - 1}\\).Thus, to solve a recurrence relation, we can attempt to convert the recurrence for \\((a_n)\\) into an equation involving its generating function \\(A\\) by finding the generating functions of the sequences equated in the recurrence; then if we can solve this for \\(A\\), then we have found \\(a_n = [x^n]A\\). However, we may not explicitly find \\(A\\) as a (formal) power series; using different techniques (such as partial fractions or the binomial theorem) we can find a power series expansion to extract the coefficients \\(a_n\\).A recurrence is linear if \\(a_{n + k} = f_0 a_n + f_1 a_{n + 1} + \\dotsb + f_{k - 1} a_{n + k - 1}\\) for some \\(k\\), where each \\(f_i\\), a coefficient, is a function of \\(n\\). We present a quick theorem without proof:Theorem 1. Let \\(A \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (a_n)\\). Then \\(A\\) is a rational function \\(p/q\\) (where \\(p,q\\) have lowest possible degree) with \\(\\deg q = k\\) if and only if \\((a_n)\\) satisfies a linear recurrence with constant coefficients of order \\(k\\).After reading this article, you will have the tools to prove this theorem yourself! (If you want to, of course!) One direction is by the technique for finding a generating function outlined below, and the other direction follows by considering an expansion of \\(q A = p\\).The algebra and calculus of generating functionsDefinition 3. The (formal) derivative of a power series \\(A = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} a_nx^n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (a_n)\\) is the power series\\[DA = \\sum_{n \\geq 1} n a_n x^{n - 1} = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} (n + 1)a_{n + 1}x^n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} ((n + 1)a_{n + 1}).\\]The derivative operator \\(D\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) is the map \\(A \\mapsto DA\\).We can verify some expected properties of the derivative operator: it is a derivation on \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) (let \\(A,B \\in \\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\)), since It is linear (where we think of \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) as a vector space): \\(D(A + kB) = DA + kDB\\) where \\(k \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), It satisfies a sort of (Leibniz) product rule: \\(D(AB) = A(DB) + (DA)B\\).Exercise 2. Check thse both! Remember to use the correct rule for multiplying power series for the product rule.We can also combine the derivative operator with other operators on \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\). For operators \\(S,T\\), define their sum \\(S + T\\) to be the map \\(A \\mapsto SA + TA\\) (pointwise addtion), and their product \\(ST\\) to be the map \\(A \\mapsto S(TA)\\) (composition of operators). The \\(k\\)th iterate of \\(T\\) is defined by \\(T^k := \\underbrace{TT\\dotsb T}_{k\\ \\text{copies}}\\), which is the map \\(A \\mapsto \\underbrace{T(T(\\dotsb(TA)\\dotsb))}_{k\\ \\text{times}}\\).Repeated differentiation is denoted by \\(D^k\\), i.e. \\(D^kA\\) is the \\(k\\)th (formal) derivative of \\(A\\). Another common operator that comes up when solving recurrences is the ecks dee xD operator \\(xD\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\), defined as the map \\(A \\mapsto xDA\\), i.e. differentiation then multiplication by \\(x\\). We often deal with polynomials in \\(xD\\), where \\(1\\) denotes the identity operator \\(A \\mapsto A\\), but note that \\((xD)^2 = xD(xD) \\neq x^2 D^2\\). Indeed,\\[(xD)^2 = xD(xD) = x(D + xD^2) = xD + x^2D^2 \\implies (xD)^2A = xDA + x^2D^2A\\]by the product rule. Furthermore, care must be taken as these operators do not generally commute: while \\(xD(xD + 1) = (xD)^2 + xD = (xD + 1)xD\\), note that \\(Dx \\neq xD\\) (we can think of $x$ as an operator on \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) with \\(A \\mapsto xA\\); then \\(Dx1 = Dx = 1 \\neq 0 = xD1\\)). This is all related to the notion of a Weyl algebra, which is a ring of differential operators with polynomial coefficients (the addition is pointwise addition, and the product is composition of operators).Exercise 3. Similar to the above, what is an expansion of \\((xD)^k\\) without any powers of \\(xD\\)? (I haven’t tried this yet, but it looks promising.) Update (thanks Ally and Jacob): it looks like\\[(xD)^k = \\left\\{k \\atop 0\\right\\} + \\left\\{k \\atop 1\\right\\} xD + \\left\\{k \\atop 2\\right\\} x^2D^2 + \\dotsb + \\left\\{k \\atop k\\right\\} x^k D^k,\\]where\\[\\left\\{k \\atop n\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{i = 0}^n (-1)^i \\binom{n}{i} (n - i)^k\\]are Stirling numbers of the 2nd kind, which count the number of ways to partition \\([n] = \\{1,\\dotsc,n\\}\\) into \\(k\\) (nonempty) parts. (Note that \\(\\left\\{k \\atop 0\\right\\} = 0\\) if \\(k \\geq 1\\), but \\(\\left\\{0 \\atop 0\\right\\} = 1\\), and \\((xD)^0 = 1 = \\operatorname{Id}_{\\mathbb{R}[[x]]}\\), so the pattern holds.) Prove/disprove this claim, and post your solutions in the comments or in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!Using these, we can identify some rules for the generating functions of some transformations of sequences:Lemma 2. Let \\((a_n) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} A\\) and \\((b_n) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} B\\). Then For any fixed \\(m &gt; 0\\), \\((a_{n + m}) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{x^m}(A - a_0 - a_1x - \\dotsb - a_{m - 1}x^{m - 1})\\) If \\(p(n)\\) is any polynomial in \\(n\\), then \\(p(xD)A \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (p(n)a_n)\\) \\[AB \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\sum_{k = 0}^n a_k b_{n - k}\\right)_n\\] For any \\(k \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\(A + kB \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (a_n + kb_n)\\) \\[\\frac{A}{1 - x} \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\sum_{k = 0}^n a_k\\right)_n\\] For a fixed \\(k &gt; 0\\), if \\(b_{kn} = a_n\\) for \\(n \\geq 0\\) and \\(b_m = 0\\) otherwise, then \\(A(x^k) = B(x) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (b_n)\\)Note that in rule 1, we don’t mean division by \\(x^m\\) in the ring \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\), as it does not have an inverse. Rather, it is the quotient in an Euclidean division (note that \\(\\mathbb{R}[[x]]\\) is a Euclidean domain).We give a proof of rule 2; it suffices to prove it for monic monomials; then apply rule 4. Let \\(p(n) = n^k\\); then \\(p(xD)A = (xD)^kA\\). The case \\(k = 0\\) is trivial. Then if \\(k &gt; 0\\), we proceed by induction on \\(k\\) and note that\\[p(xD)A = (xD)^kA = xD(xD)^{k - 1}A = xD \\sum_{n \\geq 0} n^{k - 1}a_n x^n = x \\sum_{n \\geq 1} n^ka_n x^{n - 1} = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} n^ka_n x^n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (n^ka_n) = (p(n)a_n);\\]the 3rd equality is by the inductive hypothesis (i.e. that \\((xD)^{k - 1}A = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} n^{k - 1}a_n x^n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (n^{k - 1}a_n)\\)). Thus we are done!Exercise 4. Prove the unproven generating function rules 1,3,4,5,6 above. (Hint for rule 5: use rule 3 and Lemma 1.) Post your solutions in the comments or in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!Finding formulas for the geometric and arithmetic sequencesUsing the algebra and calculus of generating functions, we give a succinct generatingfunctionological proof of the formulas for the geometric and arithmetic sequences.Recall that the geometric sequence \\((a_n)_{n \\geq 0}\\) satisfies \\(a_{n + 1} = r a_n\\). Let \\((a_n) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} A\\). Then by rule 1, \\((a_{n + 1}) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{x}(A - a_0)\\), so the recurrence (and rule 4) yields\\[\\frac{1}{x}(A - a_0) = rA \\implies A = \\frac{a_0}{1 - rx}.\\]Extracting coefficients and using (the surprise tool) linearity, we recover\\[a_n = [x^n]A = a_0[x^n]\\sum_{n \\geq 0}(rx)^n = a_0r^n.\\]Now, the arithmetic sequence \\((b_n)_{n \\geq 0}\\) satisfies \\(b_{n + 1} = b_n + d\\). Let \\((b_n) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} B\\). Then by rule 1, \\((b_{n + 1}) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{x}(B - b_0)\\); Lemma 1 and rule 4 yields \\((d) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\frac{d}{1 - x}\\), so the recurrence (and rule 4) yields (by partial fractions)\\[\\frac{1}{x}(B - b_0) = B + \\frac{d}{1 - x} \\implies B = \\frac{b_0 - d}{1 - x} + \\frac{d}{(1 - x)^2}.\\]By rule 2 with \\(p(n) = n\\), we have\\[xD\\frac{1}{1 - x} \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (p(n)1) = (n) \\implies \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = \\frac{1}{x} \\left(xD\\frac{1}{1 - x} - 0\\right) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (n + 1)\\]by rule 1. (There are other ways to do this, such as direct manipulation of the power series, but that’s boring!) Thus by linearity, we extract the coefficient\\[b_n = [x^n]B = (b_0 - d)[x^n]\\frac{1}{1 - x} + d[x^n]\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = (b_0 - d)1 + d(n + 1) = b_0 + dn\\]since \\((1) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{1 - x}\\) and \\((n + 1) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}\\) (recall what this means). This is the formula for the arithmetic sequence; how awesome! (OK that was totally overkill LOL.)Exercise 5. Show that\\[\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (n + 1)\\]in the following alternative ways: Use the fact that \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = D\\frac{1}{1 - x}\\), and explicitly differentiating the power series \\(\\sum_{n \\geq 0} x^n\\) and identifying the coefficient that appears. Use the fact that \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = D\\frac{1}{1 - x}\\) again, but look at the comment in Definition 3 (i.e. that \\(DA \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} ((n + 1)a_{n + 1}).\\) if \\(A \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} (a_n)\\); choose \\((a_n)\\) carefully). Use fact 5 repeatedly, starting from $A = 1$. (What sequence is this the generating function of?)Post your solutions in the comments or in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!A few more applications (an outline only)There are many nice applications of this generatingfunctionological technique. Here are just a few: The Fibonacci sequence \\((F_n)\\) satisfies the linear recurrence \\(F_{n + 2} = F_{n + 1} + F_n\\) for \\(n \\geq 0\\) with \\(F_0 = 0\\) and \\(F_1 = 1\\). It has generating function \\(F = \\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}\\); we can recover a formula for \\(F_n\\) using partial fractions. The binomial theorem \\((1 + x)^\\alpha = \\sum_{n \\geq 0} \\binom{\\alpha}{n} x^n \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} \\left(\\binom{\\alpha}{n}\\right)_n\\) where \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). I talk about this in more detail in the next post! The Catalan numbers \\(C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n}\\) have generating function \\(C = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x}\\); using the binomial theorem with \\(\\alpha = 1/2\\), we can recover this formula for \\(C_n\\). Moreover, they satisfy the recurrence \\(C_{n + 1} = \\sum_{i = 0}^n C_i C_{n - i}\\) with \\(C_0 = 1\\); note that \\(\\left(\\sum_{i = 0}^n C_i C_{n - i}\\right) \\overset{\\text{ops}}{\\leftrightarrow} C^2\\) by rule 3, so \\(\\frac{1}{x}(C - 1) = \\frac{1}{x}(C - C_0) = C^2 \\iff C - 1 = xC^2\\), which can be used to find \\(C\\) as before (use the initial condition \\(C_0 = 1\\) to pick the negative square root). Note that \\(C_n\\) is, for instance, the number of ways to have a balanced string of parentheses of length \\(2n\\), e.g. something like (()(()))(()), but not ())((()).Exercise 6. (Adapted from discussion on the Maths @ Monash Discord server.) Consider the triangular numbers \\(T_n = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\\), and define a recurrence \\(a_{n + 1} = a_n + T_n\\), with \\(a_0 = 0\\). Find a linear recurrence with constant coefficients that \\((a_n)\\) satisfies (consider Theorem 1 above), and use a generatingfunctionological approach to find an explicit formula for \\(a_n\\) (feel free to use a computer to find a series expansion).

But what about a rational function \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) where \\(p,q\\) are polynomials? Is the indefinite integral\\(\\int \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\,dx\\)a family of elementary functions? It turns out that it is — that is, in theory at least, we can take any rational function and write its integral explicitly using “nice” functions (namely other rational functions, logarithms, and arctangents).The key idea is to use polynomial division with remainder, and partial fraction decomposition. It might be obvious what the solution is now, but not so fast: have you ever thought about how and why partial fractions work? And can we do it without complex numbers in the (result of the) integral? Must the coefficients be real, or can they be complex too? And does this process perhaps… generalise? We will answer these questions (and more), by delving into the mysterious world of abstract algebra. (This will probably be the first of many posts on algebra, which is a field of maths that is close to my heart.)A quick recap on partial fractionsYou may have previously learnt partial fractions to solve the problem of integrating certain rational functions (or simply plotting rational functions). More or less, the process looks like the following: we have a rational function (a quotient of polynomials)\\[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\]where the degree of \\(p\\) is strictly less than the degree of \\(q\\). We then factorise \\(q\\) into\\[q(x) = q_1(x)^{a_1} q_2(x)^{a_2} \\dotsb q_k(x)^{a_k}\\]where typically the \\(q_i\\) are irreducible in the sense that there are no nontrivial factorisations of \\(q_i\\) into a product of lower degree polynomials (and each \\(a_i \\in \\mathbb Z^+\\)). Then we can write\\[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{a_1} \\frac{p_{1j}(x)}{q_1(x)^j} + \\sum_{j = 1}^{a_2} \\frac{p_{2j}(x)}{q_2(x)^j} + \\dotsb + \\sum_{j = 1}^{a_k} \\frac{p_{kj}(x)}{q_k(x)^j}\\]where \\(\\deg p_{ij} &lt; \\deg q_i\\) for all \\(i,j\\).For example, for given \\(a,b,c,d,e \\in \\mathbb R\\), we may decompose\\[\\frac{ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e}{x(x - 1)^2(x^2 + x + 1)} = \\frac{A}{x} + \\frac{B}{x - 1} + \\frac{C}{(x - 1)^2} + \\frac{Dx + E}{x^2 + x + 1}.\\]A usual technique is, once we have the correct form of the partial fraction decomposition, we cross-multiply to yield\\[ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = A(x - 1)^2(x^2 + x + 1) + Bx(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) + Cx(x^2 + x + 1) + (Dx + E)x(x - 1)^2,\\]which, considering as an equation in \\(\\mathbb R_4[x]\\) (the vector space of real polynomials of degree at most 4) and explicitly rewriting the right-hand side as a linear combination of basis polynomials \\(x^4,x^3,x^2,x,1\\), allows us to compare coefficients and form a system of 5 equations in 5 variables, which must be consistent (as we will see in the existence of decomposition proof). Gaussian elimination (or another approach) then yields the unique coefficients \\(A,B,C,D,E \\in \\mathbb R\\), at which point we have found the partial fraction decomposition.Partial fractions for… fractions?Partial fractions for rational functions is something that most people have studied. But you may be more surprised to find out that the same process works if we replace the real number polynomial coefficients with any other field (essentially a set with addition and multiplication, where you can divide by anything nonzero), e.g. the complex numbers, rationals, or integers modulo a prime! Perhaps even more surprisingly, we can do partial fractions for the rational numbers \\(\\mathbb Q\\).What exactly do I mean? We start off with a proper fraction (numerator is less than denominator). We can let prime numbers take the place of irreducible (quadratic and linear) polynomials on the denominators, and instead of the condition that the degree of the numerator is strictly less than that of the irreducible polynomial in the denominator, we require that the absolute value of the numerator is strictly less than that of the prime in the denominator. For example, I calculated that\\[\\frac{37}{300} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{4}{5^2}.\\]Why should this be the correct generalisation? In the proof of the existence of a partial fraction decomposition, we will see that we don’t need to explicitly assume we are working with polynomials. In fact, the same argument works for any Euclidean domain, which is, roughly speaking, a set with addition, multiplication, and a null factor law, where we can also perform division with remainder (with a notion of size called a valuation). For real polynomials (which are building blocks of rational functions), the valuation is the degree function, but in the integers (which are building blocks of the rationals), a valuation is the absolute value function. The notion of an Euclidean domain is abstract algebraic, but allows us to abstract away from a concrete construction and prove results simultaneously for a general class of objects; furthermore, the algorithm in each Euclidean domain is identical, up to the actual division with remainder algorithm. And this is just a taste of the power of abstract algebra.Rings, fields, and Euclidean domainsThis section will be a self-contained brief introduction to the relevant ring theory required for the proof. It may seem very definition heavy, and if you cannot follow, feel free to skip (at your own risk) to part 2. We firstly define rings.Definition 1. A binary operation on a set \\(X\\) is a map \\(f : X \\times X \\to X\\) from the Cartesian product. It takes in two elements of \\(X\\), and returns a single element, also in \\(X\\). We often write \\(f(x,y) = x * y\\).Some properties of a binary operation \\(* : X \\times X \\to X\\) may include: Commutativity: for all \\(x,y \\in X\\), \\(x * y = y * x\\). (Order doesn’t matter.) Associativity: for all \\(x,y,z \\in X\\), \\((x * y) * z = x * (y * z)\\). (Brackets don’t matter.) Identity: there is an \\(e \\in X\\) such that \\(e * x = x * e = x\\) for all \\(x \\in X\\). (Applying \\(e\\) doesn’t do anything.) Inverses: if \\(e\\) is the identity, then for any \\(x \\in X\\), there exists \\(y \\in X\\) such that \\(x * y = y * x = e\\). (You can undo everything.)For example, addition on \\(\\mathbb R\\) (but also \\(\\mathbb Z,\\mathbb Q,\\mathbb C\\)) satisfies all 4 above criteria, with identity \\(e = 0\\) and inverse \\(y = -x\\) for \\(x \\in \\mathbb R\\). (However, inverses is not satisfied if we take addition on \\(\\mathbb N\\); 1 has no inverse.) Multiplication (on \\(\\mathbb R\\)) is commutative, associative, and has identity \\(1\\). Subtraction is a binary operation, but is neither commutative nor associative, and has no identity! (Can you see why?)Challenge question 1. Prove that on \\(\\mathbb R\\), subtraction is a binary operation that is not commutative, associative, and has no identity. Identify which of division on \\(\\mathbb R\\), exponentiation on \\(\\mathbb R^+\\), maximum on \\(\\mathbb R\\), and greatest common divisor on \\(\\mathbb Z^+\\) are binary operations, and which of the above properties they possess (if they are binary operations). Post your solutions in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!Definition 2. A (unital) ring \\((R,+,{\\cdot})\\) is a set \\(R\\) with two binary operations \\(+\\) (addition) and \\(\\cdot\\) (multiplication), satisfying: (A1) Addition is commutative (A2) Addition is associative (A3) Addition has an identity, \\(0\\) (called zero) (A4) Each element \\(r \\in R\\) has an inverse under addition, \\(-r\\) (called the negative) (M1) Multiplication is associative (M2) Multiplication has an identity, \\(1\\) (called unity) (AM) Multiplication distributes over addition: for \\(r,s,t \\in R\\), \\(r \\cdot (s + t) = (r \\cdot s) + (r \\cdot t)\\) and \\((r + s)\\cdot t = (r \\cdot t) + (s \\cdot t)\\)Properties (A1)–(A4) imply \\((R,+)\\) is an abelian group. Property (AM) implies multiplication and addition interact nicely. These properties are often called axioms. Additionally, multiplication takes precedence over addition, i.e. \\(r \\cdot s + t = (r \\cdot s) + t\\) and \\(r + s \\cdot t = r + (s \\cdot t)\\). (We often drop the \\(\\cdot\\) when performing multiplication, and write \\(rs = r \\cdot s\\).) Rings in which multiplication is also commutative are the creatively-named commutative rings.Some examples of (unital) rings include \\(\\mathbb R,\\mathbb C,\\mathbb Q,\\mathbb Z\\) under the usual addition and multiplication (with zero \\(0\\) and unity \\(1\\)), continuous functions under the usual pointwise addition and multiplication, the set of \\(n \\times n\\) square matrices \\(M_n(R)\\) over a ring \\(R\\) (with zero the zero matrix, and unity the identity matrix with the unity from \\(R\\) down the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere; here, multiplication is not commutative!), and polynomial rings (which we discuss later).Definition 3. A unit in a (unital) ring (with unity \\(1\\)) is an element \\(u \\in R\\) such that there exists \\(v \\in R\\) with \\(uv = vu = 1\\); then \\(v = u^{-1}\\) is a (multiplicative) inverse of \\(u\\). The set of units in \\(R\\) is denoted \\(R^*\\); it is a group (it satisfies precisely (A2)–(A4) plus closure, but for multiplication instead), called the unit group.Challenge question 2. Prove, using the axioms only, that the zero \\(0\\) and unity \\(1\\) are unique in a ring. Thus prove that if additive or multiplicative inverses exist, then they are unique. Prove that \\(R^* := \\{u \\in R : u\\ \\text{is a unit}\\}\\) forms a group under multiplication from \\(R\\). (That is, multiplication is a binary operation (i.e. the product of two units is a unit), it is associative, has an identity, and every element has an inverse.)Challenge question 3. Let us consider the ring of \\(2 \\times 2\\) integer matrices \\(M_2(\\mathbb Z)\\), endowed with the usual addition and multiplication of square matrices (from say \\(M_2(\\mathbb R)\\)). Argue that if\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{pmatrix} \\in M_2(\\mathbb Z)\\] has a (multiplicative) inverse \\(A^{-1} \\in M_2(\\mathbb Z)\\) such that \\(AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I\\) (where \\(I\\) is the usual \\(2 \\times 2\\) identity matrix), then \\(A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad - bc} \\begin{pmatrix} d &amp; -b \\\\ -c &amp; a \\end{pmatrix} \\in M_2(\\mathbb R)\\). Thus conclude that \\(A \\in M_2(\\mathbb Z)\\) has an inverse if and only if \\(\\det A \\in \\{\\pm 1\\} = \\mathbb Z^*\\). This proves that the unit group is \\(GL_2(\\mathbb Z) := (M_2(\\mathbb Z))^* = \\{A \\in M_2(\\mathbb Z) : \\det A = \\pm 1\\}\\). Use this to conjecture what \\(GL_n(\\mathbb Z) := (M_n(\\mathbb Z))^*\\) is, for any integer \\(n \\geq 1\\). Prove that for any commutative (unital) ring \\(R\\) (where multiplication is commutative), \\(GL_2(R) := (M_2(R))^* = \\{A \\in M_2(R) : \\det A \\in R^*\\}\\), where the determinant is defined as usual. This is the general linear group: the set of invertible matrices with entries in \\(R\\). (Compare this to what you know when \\(R = \\mathbb R\\) or \\(\\mathbb C\\).)Post your solutions in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!Fields, division rings, and the quaternionsDefinition 4. A field \\(K\\) is a commutative (unital) ring such that \\(K^* = K \\setminus \\{0\\}\\), that is, every nonzero element has a (multiplicative) inverse. (It follows that \\(K \\setminus \\{0\\}\\) is an abelian group under multiplication.)Some examples of fields include \\(\\mathbb R,\\mathbb C,\\mathbb Q\\), and also the integers modulo \\(p\\) where \\(p\\) is prime: \\(\\mathbb Z_p\\). Fields are also the building blocks of linear algebra: the scalars in a vector space belong to a field. If we remove the condition that the ring is commutative (but maintain the requirement that \\(F^* = F \\setminus \\{0\\}\\)), we get a skew-field or division ring: a prominent example is \\(\\mathbb H\\), the quaternions, which is a 4-dimensional \\(\\mathbb R\\)-vector space with (abstract) basis elements \\(1,i,j,k\\) with multiplication satisfying \\(1\\alpha = \\alpha 1 = \\alpha\\) and \\(\\lambda\\alpha = \\alpha\\lambda\\) for all \\(\\alpha \\in \\mathbb H\\) and \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb R\\), and\\[i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\\]Challenge question 4. We work with the quaternions \\(\\mathbb H\\). Recall that we define multiplication so that it is a ring (it is associative, and distributes over addition). Show that \\(ij = k\\), \\(jk = i\\), \\(ki = j\\), \\(ji = -k\\), \\(kj = -i\\), and \\(ik = -j\\). (Think of this with \\(ijk\\) written cyclically, with a negative sign if we go backwards.) What is \\(i^{-1}\\), \\(j^{-1}\\), and \\(k^{-1}\\)? For \\(\\alpha = a + bi + cj + dk \\in \\mathbb H\\) (where \\(a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb R\\)), define \\(\\bar\\alpha = a - bi - cj - dk\\). Define the norm \\(\\lvert\\alpha\\rvert = \\sqrt{\\alpha\\bar \\alpha}\\). Show that \\(\\lvert\\alpha\\rvert^2 \\in \\mathbb R_{\\geq 0}\\) (using distributive laws and part 1), so that this makes sense. Prove that \\(\\lvert\\alpha\\beta\\rvert = \\lvert\\alpha\\rvert \\lvert\\beta\\rvert\\) for \\(\\alpha,\\beta \\in \\mathbb H\\), and that \\(\\lvert\\alpha\\rvert = 0\\) if and only if \\(\\alpha = 0\\). (Hint: show that \\(\\lvert\\alpha\\beta\\rvert^2 = \\lvert\\alpha\\rvert^2 \\lvert\\beta\\rvert^2\\).) If \\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\), Let \\(\\beta = \\bar\\alpha/\\lvert\\alpha\\rvert^2 \\in \\mathbb H\\). What is \\(\\alpha\\beta\\) and \\(\\beta\\alpha\\)? Thus conclude that \\(\\mathbb H^* = \\mathbb H \\setminus \\{0\\}\\), i.e. that \\(\\mathbb H\\) is a division ring.Post your solutions in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!Definition 5. A subset \\(S \\subseteq R\\) is a subring of a ring \\((R,+,\\cdot)\\) if \\((S,+,\\cdot)\\) is a ring, when the binary operations are restricted to \\(S\\) (in particular, must be maps \\(S \\times S \\to S\\)). Replacing “ring” with “field”, we get the notion of a subfield.Euclidean domains and the Euclidean algorithmDefinition 6. An Euclidean domain (ED) is a commutative (unital) ring \\(R\\) with a valuation (or Euclidean function) \\(\\nu : R \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb N\\) such that: (No zero divisors) if \\(ab = 0\\) for \\(a,b \\in R\\), then \\(a = 0\\) or \\(b = 0\\) (so that it is an integral domain), (Division with remainder) if \\(a,b \\in R\\) with \\(b \\neq 0\\), there exist \\(q,r \\in R\\) with \\(a = qb + r\\) with \\(\\nu(r) &lt; \\nu(b)\\) or \\(r = 0\\), if \\(a,b \\in R\\) with \\(a,b \\neq 0\\), then \\(\\nu(a) \\leq \\nu(ab)\\).In particular, \\(\\mathbb Z\\) is an Euclidean domain with valuation \\(\\nu(z) = \\lvert z \\rvert\\). So are the Gaussian integers, \\(\\mathbb Z[i] := \\{a + bi : a,b \\in \\mathbb Z\\}\\) with valuation \\(\\nu(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2\\). So is any field \\(K\\), with valuation \\(\\nu(\\alpha) = 1\\). (As we will shortly see, and as may be suggestive, polynomial rings over fields are also Euclidean domains with the degree as the valuation!)In Euclidean domains (and in integral domains), we have a notion of divisibility, and a notion of primality: irreducibility.Definition 7. If \\(R\\) is an ED and \\(a,b \\in R\\), then \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\) (and \\(a\\) is a divisor of \\(b\\)), written \\(a \\mid b\\), if there is \\(k \\in R\\) such that \\(b = ka\\).Definition 8. If \\(r = ab\\) implies \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is a unit (in \\(R^*\\)), then \\(r\\) is irreducible. Otherwise, it is reducible, and there are non-units \\(a,b\\) with \\(r = ab\\). This is essentially a nontrivial factorisation.The definition of irreducible looks very much like the definition of a prime in \\(\\mathbb N\\) (or \\(\\mathbb Z\\)). In fact, it is precisely the same definition: it essentially says that if \\(p = ab\\) implies \\(a = 1\\) or \\(b = 1\\) (over \\(\\mathbb N\\)), then \\(p\\) is prime, which essentially is the usual definition. In Euclidean domains (and integral domains), there is another notion or prime element: one such that \\(p \\mid ab\\) implies \\(p \\mid a\\) or \\(p \\mid b\\). It turns out that they are equivalent to irreducible elements in EDs! Moreover, in Euclidean domains, we have an analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that holds:Theorem 9. Every Euclidean domain has unique factorisation into irreducibles: if \\(a \\in R\\) is nonzero and not a unit, then there are irreducible elements \\(p_1,...,p_r \\in R\\) such that \\(a = p_1p_2 \\dotsb p_r\\). Moreover, this representation is unique up to multiplication (of each irreducible) by units.For example, in \\(\\mathbb Z\\), we know that \\(12 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3\\). But we may also write \\(12 = 2 \\cdot (-2) \\cdot (-3)\\); we note that \\(-2 = (-1) \\cdot 2\\) and \\(-3 = (-1) \\cdot 3\\), which is multiplication by the unit \\(-1\\). There is no way to factorise \\(12\\) into primes a completely different way. Now, in \\(\\mathbb R[x]\\) (polynomials with real coefficients), we may write \\(2x^2 + 10x + 12 = (x + 2)(2x + 6) = (2x + 4)(x + 3)\\); note that the irreducible linear terms in these two expressions only differ by muliplying/dividing by the unit \\(2\\).We are ready for the Euclidean algorithm. Recall that in the integers, it provides us a way to find the greatest common divisor of two integers, using division with remainder. This suggests that the Euclidean algorithm may also work in Euclidean domains… but first, what even is a greatest common divisor?Definition 10. if \\(R\\) is an ED and \\(a,b \\in R\\), an element \\(d \\in R\\) is a common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) if \\(d \\mid a\\) and \\(d \\mid b\\). A greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is an common divisor \\(g \\in R\\) of \\(a,b\\), such that for all common divisors \\(d\\) of \\(a,b\\), we have \\(d \\mid g\\).Greatest common divisors are not unique in general, but are unique up to units: \\(g\\) is a gcd of \\(a,b\\) if and only if \\(ug\\) is a gcd of \\(a,b\\) for some unit \\(u \\in R^*\\). For example, \\(6\\) is a gcd of \\(12\\) and \\(18\\), but so is \\(-6\\). \\(x + 3\\) is a gcd of \\((x + 2)(x + 3),(x - 4)(x + 3) \\in \\mathbb R[x]\\), but so is \\(2x + 6\\): note that \\((x + 2)(x + 3) = (\\frac{1}{2}x + 1)(2x + 6)\\) and \\((x - 4)(x + 3) = (\\frac{1}{2}x - 2)(2x + 6)\\).Algorithm 10 (Euclidean algorithm).Valuations, gcds, Euclidean algorithm, etcTo be continued…Make sure you read part 2, which can be found here soon." }, { "title": "An 3D-on-2D interactive visualisation of immersed surfaces on Desmos", "url": "/posts/desmos-3d-plotter/", "categories": "Epic Maths Time, Cool Stuff", "tags": "geometry, linear-algebra, uni-maths, maths, essay, highlights", "date": "2021-06-20 00:40:00 +1000", "snippet": "The below was submitted as my essay for the final assignment in the unit MTH3110 – Differential Geometry, at Monash University, in Semester 1, 2021.

I’ve chosen to upload it here for those who may have seen my Desmos surface visualisation, and are interested in how I derived it! However, it assumes familiarity, especially near the end, with differential-geometric quantities such as maps of surfaces and their derivatives, and tangent spaces.Note (2026 update): Desmos now has a full 3D graphing mode, officially released in September 2023. It lets you switch between orthographic and perspective projection using a ‘perspective’ slider.But back in 2021, when I wrote this assignment, Desmos had no 3D engine at all. Everything you see below – rotating surfaces, changing viewpoints, and the wireframe rendering – was built entirely inside the 2D calculator using linear algebra and differential geometry, to produce an orthographic projection of 3D surfaces on a 2D screen. This post explains how that construction worked.Some examples of surface visualisationsHere are a couple of versions of the Desmos save file with different cool pre-loaded plots: The default: a hemisphere (select the second plot for a full sphere) A Möbius band A heliocoid An immersed Klein bottle in \\(\\mathbb R^3\\) (thanks to cFOURbon for entering the formula) A heart-shaped surface A shell (thanks to Kevin D. for the help and idea) Give me my chemistry degree immediately?Here is the Möbius band Desmos 3D-on-2D visualisation embedded:The explanation and geometry of the Desmos visualisationHere is an interactive visualisation of surfaces on Desmos (a graphing website), made by me. It takes a (continuous) function \\(f : U \\to \\mathbb R\\), for some \\(U \\subseteq \\mathbb R^2\\), and plots a projection of the graph of \\(f\\) onto \\(\\mathbb R^2\\) as a “wire-frame”; it can also take a parametrisation \\(\\sigma : U \\to \\mathbb R^3\\) and plot a projection of its image in the plane.1 We discuss the algebra and geometry used in its construction, and some geometric properties of the projection map. Henceforth, let us assume that \\(U\\) is open, \\(f\\) is a smooth function, and that \\(\\sigma\\) is a regular surface patch.Projecting down to a planeThere are many ways to project \\(\\mathbb R^3\\), onto \\(\\mathbb R^2\\). However, a way to choose a sensible, well-behaved projection is to choose a plane \\(\\Pi\\) through the origin (a linear subspace of \\(\\mathbb R^3\\)), and perform an orthogonal projection \\(\\pi'\\). Such a plane can be uniquely determined by using spherical coordinates. Consider an “observer” at \\(N \\in S^2\\), the unit sphere, and a standard map \\(\\tau : \\mathbb R^2 \\to S^2\\) given by\\[\\tau(u,v) = (\\cos u\\cos v,\\cos u\\sin v,\\sin u);\\]here, \\((u,v)\\) respectively measure latitude and longitude.2 The unit vectors in \\(T_0\\mathbb R^3\\) (denoting possible directions from the origin) are precisely points on \\(S^2\\). Thus, we may take \\(\\Pi\\) as the orthogonal complement of the span of \\(\\{N\\}\\).A fact from differential geometry is that \\(T_N S^2 = \\{v \\in \\mathbb R^3 : N \\cdot v = 0\\}\\). If \\(v \\in \\Pi\\), then for any \\(kN \\in \\operatorname{span}\\{N\\}\\) (where \\(k \\in \\mathbb R\\)), \\((kN) \\cdot v = k(N \\cdot v) = 0\\). In particular, \\(N \\cdot v = 0\\), so \\(v \\in T_NS^2\\). Conversely, a vector \\(v \\in T_NS^2\\) satisfies \\((kN) \\cdot v = k(N \\cdot v) = 0\\) for all \\(k \\in \\mathbb R\\), so \\(v \\in \\Pi\\). This means that \\(\\Pi = T_NS^2\\), and \\(N\\) is normal to this tangent space.Next, we consider the problem of projecting from \\(\\mathbb R^3\\) into \\(\\Pi\\) (and then into \\(\\mathbb R^2\\)). Given an orthonormal basis \\(b = \\{b_1,b_2\\}\\) for \\(\\Pi\\) that extends to a right-handed orthonormal basis \\(b' = \\{b_1,b_2,N\\}\\) of \\(\\mathbb R^3\\), where \\(N = b_1 \\times b_2\\), consider the orthogonal projection \\(\\pi' : \\mathbb R^3 \\to \\Pi\\). Since \\(\\ker\\pi' = \\Pi^\\perp\\) and \\(\\pi\\vert_\\Pi\\) is the identity, it follows that \\(\\pi'(b_1) = b_1\\), \\(\\pi'(b_2) = b_2\\), and \\(\\pi'(N) = 0\\). The map \\(\\pi'\\) is linear, so its matrix with respect to the bases \\(b',b\\) is\\[\\pi'_{b',b} =\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}.\\]The geometry of this map is as follows: take a point \\(p \\in \\mathbb R^3\\). Then the coset \\(p + \\Pi^\\perp = \\{p + kN : k \\in \\mathbb R\\}\\), a line parallel to \\(N\\) (thus orthogonal to \\(\\Pi\\)) passing through \\(p\\), is collapsed onto a point \\(\\pi'(p) \\in \\Pi\\); distinct parallel lines are collapsed to distinct points. This is an orthographic projection, where the axes are not foreshortened, that is, no length distortion due to perspective (see Figure 1).3 Under this projection, we consider \\(\\mathbb R^3\\) as the quotient \\(\\mathbb R^3/\\Pi^\\perp\\), and cannot distinguish between points on the same line parallel to \\(\\Pi^\\perp\\); the map has rank \\(2\\) and nullity \\(1\\).Figure 1: Plot of cylinder $\\sigma : (0,2\\pi) \\times (-4,4) \\to S$, $\\sigma(u,v) = (v,\\cos u,\\sin v)$ with perspective $(\\theta,\\phi) = (0.1,-0.1)$, using the Desmos visualisation. Observe that there is no distortion due to perspective (i.e. foreshortening) in the negative $x$-direction.Next, we consider the map that transforms points on \\(\\Pi\\) into points in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\). Given our basis \\(b\\) for \\(\\Pi\\), there is a natural sense in which \\(b_1\\) can be thought of as pointing “right”, and \\(b_2\\) as pointing “up”. This is described by \\(T : \\Pi \\to \\mathbb R^2\\), the linear isometry such that \\(T(b_1) = e_1\\) and \\(T(b_2) = e_2\\). Letting \\(e' = \\{e_1,e_2\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb R^2\\), \\(T\\) is simply the identity in coordinates \\(b,e'\\): \\(T_{b,e'} = I_2\\), the \\(2 \\times 2\\) identity matrix.Thus, our overall projection \\(\\pi : \\mathbb R^3 \\to \\mathbb R^2\\) in the direction of \\(\\Pi\\) would be given by \\(\\pi = T \\circ \\pi'\\), with matrix \\(T_{b,e'} \\pi'_{b',b}\\). However, we wish to express the matrix for \\(\\pi\\) with respect to the standard basis \\(e = \\{e_1,e_2,e_3\\}\\) for \\(\\mathbb R^3\\). For this, we recall that the change-of-basis matrix from \\(b'\\) to \\(e\\) is given by\\[M_{b' \\to e} =\\begin{pmatrix} \\vert &amp; \\vert &amp; \\vert \\\\ b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; N \\\\ \\vert &amp; \\vert &amp; \\vert\\end{pmatrix}.\\]Since \\(b'\\) is an orthonormal set, it follows that \\(M_{b' \\to e} \\in O(3)\\), so \\(M_{e \\to b'} = (M_{b' \\to e})^{-1} = (M_{b' \\to e})^\\top\\). It follows that the matrix for \\(\\pi\\) w.r.t. the bases \\(e,e'\\) of \\(\\mathbb R^3,\\mathbb R^2\\) respectively is\\[\\pi_{e,e'} = T_{b,e'} \\pi'_{b',b} M_{e \\to b'} =\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} \\text{---} &amp; b_1 &amp; \\text{---} \\\\ \\text{---} &amp; b_2 &amp; \\text{---} \\\\ \\text{---} &amp; N &amp; \\text{---}\\end{pmatrix} =\\begin{pmatrix} \\text{---} &amp; b_1 &amp; \\text{---} \\\\ \\text{---} &amp; b_2 &amp; \\text{---}\\end{pmatrix} =: M.\\]Now, recall that there is a pair \\((\\theta,\\phi)\\) corresponding to \\(N = \\tau(\\theta,\\phi)\\). For simplicity, we will assume that \\(\\theta \\in (-\\pi/2,\\pi/2)\\), so that a suitable restriction of \\(\\tau\\) forms a regular chart for \\(S^2\\). We aim to find an orthonormal basis for \\(\\Pi\\) by finding an orthonormal basis for \\(T_NS^2\\). Note that \\(\\{\\tau_u,\\tau_v\\}\\) forms a basis for \\(T_NS^2\\), where\\[\\tau_u(\\theta,\\phi) = (-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi,-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\cos\\theta)\\]and\\[\\tau_v(\\theta,\\phi) = (-\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi,0).\\]It is easy to check that these are orthogonal, so an orthonormal basis \\(\\{b_1,b_2\\}\\) for \\(\\Pi\\) is found by normalising these vectors, yielding\\[b_2 = (-\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi,-\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi,\\cos\\theta)\\]and\\[b_1 = (-\\sin\\phi,\\cos\\phi,0).\\](It turns out that this also works when \\(\\theta \\in \\{\\pm\\pi/2\\}\\); these span the tangent planes \\(T_{(0,0,\\pm 1)}S^2 = \\mathbb R^2 \\times \\{0\\}\\)!) Note that we needed to take \\(b_1 = \\tau_v/\\lVert \\tau_v\\rVert\\) and \\(b_2 = \\tau_u/\\lVert \\tau_u\\rVert\\), so that indeed \\(b_1 \\times b_2 = N = \\tau(\\theta,\\phi)\\).In summary, for our perspective given by spherical coordinates \\((\\theta,\\phi)\\) (or equivalently \\(N = \\tau(\\theta,\\phi) \\in S^2\\)), the projection \\(\\pi : \\mathbb R^3 \\to \\mathbb R^2\\) is given by\\[\\begin{equation*} \\pi(x,y,z) = \\underbrace{ \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\phi &amp; \\cos\\phi &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi &amp; \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}}_{M = M(\\theta,\\phi)} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x\\sin\\phi + y\\cos\\phi \\\\ -x\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi - y\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi + z\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}. \\tag{*}\\end{equation*}\\]Visualising the surface in DesmosIf we wish to plot \\(S\\) as the graph of \\(f\\), take \\(\\sigma(u,v) = (u,v,f(u,v))\\). Then it reduces to the problem of plotting the image of \\(\\sigma\\), or at least its projection under \\(\\pi\\). It would be useless (given limitations on Desmos) to present a filled-in outline—we would get a single splotch of colour (with jagged edges)! Instead, we use the idea that the domain \\(U\\) is an open subset of \\(\\mathbb R^2,\\)4 and for fixed \\((u,v) \\in U\\), we consider the curves \\(x_u,y_v : I_u,J_v \\to U\\) in \\(U\\) (for suitable open intervals \\(I_u,J_v\\)), where \\(x_u(t) = (u,t)\\) and \\(y_v(t) = (t,v)\\), i.e. we fix the \\(u\\) or \\(v\\) coordinate, and let the other vary.Consider a set of points \\(\\{(u_i,v_i)\\}_i \\subseteq U\\), and the families of curves \\(\\{x_{u_i}\\}_i,\\{y_{v_i}\\}_i\\) so-defined. Then for each of the curves (generically called \\(\\alpha : I \\to U\\)), we plot the image of \\(\\gamma = \\sigma \\circ \\alpha : I \\to S\\), a curve in \\(S\\), under the projection \\(\\pi\\), yielding two families \\(\\{\\pi \\circ \\sigma \\circ x_{u_i}\\}_i\\) (fixing \\((x =)\\, u = u_i\\), plotted in red) and \\(\\{\\pi \\circ \\sigma \\circ y_{v_i}\\}_i\\) (fixing \\((y =)\\, v = v_i\\), plotted in blue) of curves in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\), representing moving along \\(S\\) using \\(\\sigma\\), with one input fixed. In the visualisation, we assume that \\(U = (a_1,a_2) \\times (b_1,b_2)\\) is a box,5 and take \\(n_1,n_2\\) curves of constant separation in \\(U\\) in each direction. This creates the desired projection of the “wire-frame” on \\(S\\), and varying \\((\\theta,\\phi)\\) allows us to visualise the plot of \\(S\\) from all angles, giving it a 3-dimensional effect.Differential geometry of the projection: changing perspectiveFor spherical coordinates \\((\\theta,\\phi)\\), let principal latitude denote \\(\\theta_0 \\in [-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]\\) such that there is \\(\\phi_0 \\in \\mathbb R\\) with \\(\\tau(\\theta,\\phi) = \\tau(\\theta_0,\\phi_0)\\). We see that \\(M(\\theta,\\phi)\\) is a smooth function of \\(\\theta,\\phi\\), so the matrix (and projection) smoothly varies with \\(\\theta,\\phi\\):\\[M_\\theta(\\theta,\\phi) =\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi &amp; -\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\end{pmatrix}\\]and\\[\\begin{equation*} M_\\phi(\\theta,\\phi) = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos\\phi &amp; -\\sin\\phi &amp; 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi &amp; -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\tag*{(from (*)).}\\end{equation*}\\]Fixing a point \\(p = (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb R^3\\), we can think of \\(\\pi\\) as a function \\(\\mathbb R^2 \\to \\mathbb R^2\\), where the inputs are spherical coordinates \\((\\theta,\\phi)\\); let us call this map \\(\\pi' : \\mathbb R^2 \\to \\mathbb R^2\\), \\((\\theta,\\phi) \\mapsto \\pi(p) = M(\\theta,\\phi)p\\). Then the directional derivatives of \\(\\pi'\\) are given by \\(D_{(\\theta,\\phi)}\\pi' : T_{(\\theta,\\phi)}\\mathbb R^2 \\to T_{\\pi'(\\theta,\\phi)}\\mathbb R^2\\), which is such that\\[(\\lambda,\\mu) \\mapsto \\underbrace{\\begin{pmatrix} \\vert &amp; \\vert \\\\ \\pi'_\\theta &amp; \\pi'_\\phi \\\\ \\vert &amp; \\vert\\end{pmatrix}}_{D\\pi'(\\theta,\\phi)}\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda \\\\ \\mu\\end{pmatrix} =\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -x\\cos\\phi - y\\sin\\phi \\\\ -x\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi - y\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi - z\\sin\\theta &amp; x\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi - y\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda \\\\ \\mu\\end{pmatrix}.\\]So, if we change perspective from \\((\\theta,\\phi)\\) with velocity \\((\\lambda,\\mu) \\in T_{(\\theta,\\phi)}\\mathbb R^2\\) (i.e. increasing latitude by \\(\\lambda\\) and longitude by \\(\\mu\\)), the image of \\(p\\) in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\) moves with velocity \\(D_{(\\theta,\\phi)}\\pi'(\\lambda,\\mu)\\), given explicitly above. Note that\\[D_{(\\theta,\\phi)}\\pi'(\\lambda,\\mu) = \\lambda M_\\theta(\\theta,\\phi)p + \\mu M_\\phi(\\theta,\\phi)p;\\]this relates the directional derivatives of \\(\\pi'\\) to the partial derivatives of \\(M\\).Let us consider what happens to \\(\\pi(p)\\) when we fix longitude \\(\\phi\\) and vary latitude \\(\\theta\\). Taking \\(\\lambda = 1\\) and \\(\\mu = 0\\) reveals a directional derivative of\\[M_\\theta(\\theta,\\phi)p = (0,-x\\cos\\theta\\cos\\phi - y\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi - z\\sin\\theta)\\]in the \\((1,0)\\) direction. In particular, the \\(x\\)-coordinate of \\(\\pi(p)\\) does not change when only \\(\\theta\\) is changed, which makes sense since we view this as tilting the plane \\(\\Pi\\) up or down. However, the \\(y\\)-coordinate changes at a rate precisely equal to \\(-\\tau(\\theta,\\phi) \\cdot p = -N \\cdot p = \\tau(-\\theta,\\phi + \\pi) \\cdot p\\) (since \\(\\tau\\) gives points on \\(S^2\\)). For nonzero \\(p\\), this is zero precisely when \\(p\\), or equivalently \\(p/\\lVert p\\rVert \\in S^2\\), is orthogonal to \\(N \\in S^2\\), the unit normal vector to the plane of projection \\(\\Pi\\). This holds when \\(N \\in T_{p/\\lVert p\\rVert}S^2\\); if \\(\\tau(\\mathbb R \\times \\{\\phi\\}) \\subseteq T_{p/\\lVert p\\rVert}S^2\\), then this occurs for every latitude \\(\\theta\\), but otherwise, \\(\\tau(\\mathbb R \\times \\{\\phi\\})\\) is a circle on \\(S^2\\) and intersects \\(T_{p/\\lVert p\\rVert}S^2\\) for precisely one latitude \\(\\theta\\) (modulo \\(\\pi\\)). From this, we conclude that for principal latitudes \\(\\theta\\), if \\(p/\\lVert p\\rVert = \\pm(N \\times \\tau(\\theta + \\pi/4,\\phi))\\), \\(\\pi(p)\\) is always fixed when varying latitude \\(\\theta\\) (the directional derivative is zero); otherwise, there is precisely one latitude \\(\\theta\\) (or two, whence \\(\\theta = \\pm\\pi/2\\)) for which \\(\\pi(p)\\) has velocity zero.The above observations agree with a direct calculation: the curve in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\) that \\(\\pi(p)\\) traces for fixed longitude \\(\\phi\\) is\\[\\beta_p : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R^2, \\quad \\beta_p(t) = (\\underbrace{-x\\sin\\phi + y\\cos\\phi}_{\\text{constant}},\\underbrace{-x\\sin t\\cos\\phi - y\\sin t\\sin\\phi + z\\cos t}_{\\text{trigonometric with period}\\ 2\\pi}).\\]Now, let us consider what happens to \\(\\pi(p)\\) when we fix latitude \\(\\theta\\) and vary longitude \\(\\phi\\). Taking \\(\\lambda = 0\\) and \\(\\mu = 1\\) gives a directional derivative of\\[M_\\phi(\\theta,\\phi)p = (-x\\cos\\phi - y\\sin\\phi,x\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi - y\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)\\]in the \\((0,1)\\) direction. A direct calculation gives that the curve in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\) that \\(\\pi(p)\\) traces for fixed latitude \\(\\theta\\) is\\[\\delta_p : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R^2, \\quad \\delta_p(t) = (-x\\sin t + y\\cos t,-x\\sin\\theta\\cos t - y\\sin\\theta\\sin t + z\\cos\\theta);\\]the above directional derivative is simply \\(\\dot\\delta_p(\\phi)\\). By trigonometry, we know that letting \\(T = t + \\cos^{-1}(y/\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})\\),\\[\\delta_p(t) = (\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\cos T,-\\sin\\theta\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\sin T + z\\cos\\theta);\\]this is clearly an ellipse (with period \\(2\\pi\\)) with axis lengths \\(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\) and \\(\\lvert\\sin\\theta\\rvert\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\), oriented negatively (clockwise) whenever principal latitude is positive (and positively if principal latitude is negative). Additionally, it has 4 vertices by Example 6.3 of chapter 4 (as long as \\(\\lvert\\sin\\theta\\rvert \\neq 1\\) and both axis lengths are nonzero); these vertices correspond to locations where the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\)-coordinate of \\(\\pi(p)\\) is greatest or smallest. In summary, we see that for fixed latitude \\(\\theta\\), projected points move in an elliptic shape (in a clockwise direction when viewed from with positive principal latitude); this agrees with the intuition that as we increase longitude \\(\\phi\\), in order for the normal \\(N\\) to the plane of projection \\(\\Pi\\) to point “into the screen”, points must rotate clockwise about the projected \\(z\\)-axis.This concludes our analysis of the 2-dimensional visualisation of surfaces in \\(\\mathbb R^3\\) on Desmos. We saw some commentary on the derivation of the projection, using some linear algebra. Then we proceeded to analyse how curves are represented in the plot, as a “wire-frame”, and finally, we analysed the effect of changing latitude and longitude on the positions of points in the plot, rounding off a treatment of the algebraic, analytic, and geometric properties of the visualisation.AcknowledgementsI would like to acknowledge Dan Mathews for giving useful feedback (especially with respect to interpreting the effect on changing perspective on the position of points) and verifying the procedure used to derive the projection matrix.

A function \\(f : (\\Omega,\\mathcal F) \\to (E,\\mathcal E)\\) between measurable spaces is measurable if, for any measurable subset \\(A \\in \\mathcal E\\) of \\(E\\), its preimage\\[f^{-1}(A) := \\{x \\in \\Omega : f(x) \\in A\\}\\]is measurable in \\(\\Omega\\), i.e. \\(f^{-1}(A) \\in \\mathcal F\\). If \\((E,\\mathcal T)\\) is a topological space and \\(\\mathcal E = \\mathcal B(\\mathcal T)\\), then \\(f\\) is Borel measurable.For now, we will take \\(\\Omega = E = \\mathbb R\\), and the Borel sigma algebra on \\(\\mathbb R\\). What are some examples of measurable functions? Well, it turns out that every function you can think of (well, with probability 1) will be measurable! One particularly nice class of measurable functions in this case are the continuous functions:Definition 12. A function \\(f : (\\Omega,\\tau) \\to (E,\\mathcal T)\\) between topological spaces is continuous if, for any open subset \\(A \\in \\mathcal T\\) of \\(E\\), its preimage \\(f^{-1}(A)\\) is open in \\(\\Omega\\), i.e. \\(f^{-1}(A) \\in \\tau\\).Hopefully you can see the similarity: just replace “measurable” with “open”! Again, this may be different to the usual notion of continuity that you know (nearby inputs map to nearby outputs), but they turn out to be equivalent. Here is a quick proof of the above claim:Proposition 13. Suppose \\(f : (\\Omega,\\tau) \\to (E,\\mathcal T)\\) is a continuous function. Then for a sigma algebra \\(\\mathcal F\\) on \\(\\Omega\\) that contains the Borel sigma algebra \\(\\mathcal B(\\tau)\\), the function \\(f : (\\Omega,\\mathcal F) \\to (E,\\mathcal B(\\mathcal T))\\) is measurable.Proof. Let \\(A \\in \\mathcal B(\\mathcal T)\\) be a Borel set. Recall that this means that there is a countable sequence of union/intersection/complement operations such that \\(A\\) is constructed from a (countable) family of open sets \\((A_i)_{i \\in I}\\). But note that the preimage of any union/intersection/complement is the union/intersection/complement of the preimages (in general, \\(f^{-1}(A \\cup B) = f^{-1}(A) \\cup f^{-1}(B)\\), \\(f^{-1}(A \\cap B) = f^{-1}(A) \\cap f^{-1}(B)\\), and \\(f^{-1}(A \\setminus B) = f^{-1}(A) \\setminus f^{-1}(B)\\)), so it follows that \\(f^{-1}(A)\\) is constructed from the sets \\((f^{-1}(A_i))_{i \\in I}\\) using the exact same sequence of operations. But \\(f^{-1}(A_i)\\) is open for any \\(i\\) by continuity of \\(f\\) (by definition), thus measurable (since \\(\\mathcal F\\) contains \\(\\mathcal B(\\tau)\\), which contains all open sets in \\(\\Omega\\)). So \\(f^{-1}(A)\\) is constructed from the measurable sets \\((f^{-1}(A_i))_{i \\in I}\\) using a countable sequence of union/intersection/complement operations, so \\(f^{-1}(A) \\in \\mathcal F\\) (sigma algebras are closed under these operations). \\(\\square\\)This immediately gives many, many measurable functions! Assuming the sample space is \\(\\mathbb R\\), polynomial functions, rational functions, exponentials, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions etc. are all measurable, and so are their sums, products, quotients (where defined), and compositions (which are all continuous)! So are the minimum/maximum of two continuous/measurable functions (in fact, supremums and infimums also work). So is the wild Weierstrass function, which is differentiable nowhere, but continuous everywhere, thus measurable!But it turns out that many discontinuous functions are also measurable. Let’s look at one example: the signum function\\[\\operatorname{sgn} : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R, \\quad x \\mapsto \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; x &gt; 0 \\\\ 0, &amp; x = 0 \\\\ -1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\end{cases}\\](a friend-favourite, for some reason…). To show this, we need to show that for any Borel set \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb R\\), its preimage \\(\\operatorname{sgn}^{-1}(A) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb R : \\operatorname{sgn}(x) \\in A\\}\\) is again a Borel set in \\(\\mathbb R\\). One approach considers 8 cases; we do only one. Suppose that \\(0,1 \\in A\\) but \\(-1 \\not\\in A\\). Then\\[\\operatorname{sgn}^{-1}(A) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb R : \\operatorname{sgn}(x) \\in A\\} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb R : \\operatorname{sgn}(x) \\in \\{0,1\\}\\}\\]since \\(\\operatorname{sgn}\\) only takes on values in \\(\\{0,\\pm 1\\}\\). Therefore, \\(\\operatorname{sgn}^{-1}(A) = [0,\\infty)\\); this is a Borel set since its complement is the open set \\((-\\infty,0)\\) (and open sets are always Borel sets).Challenge question 5. Complete the above proof that the signum function is measurable by identifying the remaining 7 cases, and checking that \\(\\operatorname{sgn}^{-1}(A)\\) is a Borel set in each case.Going back to our example 9 with the uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\), it now follows that the inclusion map \\(X : \\Omega \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb R, x \\mapsto x\\), is a random variable, since it is continuous (thus measurable). This is how we typically think of a random variable with a uniform distribution!Briefly, let’s consider random variables from finite probability spaces. Since the natural sigma algebra is the power set (the discrete topology), it follows that every function is measurable. So any function \\(X : \\Omega \\to E\\) is a valid random variable. Let’s now look at random variables in a bit more depth.Fun with random variablesLet’s first introduce some notation. Recall that a random variable \\(X : \\Omega \\to E\\) is a measurable function from a probability space \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mathbb P)\\) to a measurable space \\((E,\\mathcal E)\\). It’s not a variable! And it’s not even random… the “randomness” comes from the fact that a probability measure assigns “chances” to different events. Let’s now combine the notion of random variable, with the notion of probability space. This is how you’ve learnt random variables in high school/early university!For the following, we take \\(E = \\mathbb R\\). Let \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb R\\) be a Borel set. Then since \\(X\\) is measurable, \\(X^{-1}(A)\\) is a valid event. Thus we may take its probability, and we write it in the following ways:\\[\\mathbb P(X^{-1}(A)) = \\mathbb P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : X(\\omega) \\in A\\}) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A).\\]Of these, the last is probably the most familiar. But they all mean the same thing! In fact, what we mean when we write \\(X \\in A\\), is precisely the event \\(X^{-1}(A)\\)!Example 8 (continued from part 1). Recall this example, in which we had an infinite sequence of coin tosses and a sample space \\(\\Omega = \\{0,1\\}^\\infty\\). For \\(n \\geq 1\\), consider the following random variable \\(X_n : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb R,\\)\\[\\omega = (\\omega_1,\\omega_2,...) \\mapsto \\omega_n,\\]which is simply projection onto the \\(n\\)th coordinate. For example, if \\(n = 2\\) and we consider the outcome \\(\\omega = (1,0,1,0,...)\\), we get \\(X_2(\\omega) = 0\\). We can see that this essentially measures the outcome of the \\(n\\)th toss: if it was a tail, then \\(X_n(\\omega) = 0\\); if a head, then \\(X_n(\\omega) = 1\\). Assuming that each toss independently has probability \\(p \\in (0,1)\\) of appearing as a head, we observe the following: for any \\(n\\),\\[\\mathbb P(X_n = 1) = \\mathbb P(X_n^{-1}(\\{1\\})) = \\mathbb P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : X_n(\\omega) = 1\\}) = p,\\]by our assertion. Similarly, \\(\\mathbb P(X_n = 0) = \\mathbb P(\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : X_n(\\omega) = 0\\}) = 1 - p\\), since\\[X_n^{-1}(0) \\cup X_n^{-1}(1) = X_n^{-1}(\\{0,1\\}) = \\Omega\\]and\\[X_n^{-1}(0) \\cap X_n^{-1}(1) = X_n^{-1}(\\{0\\} \\cap \\{1\\}) = X_n^{-1}(\\varnothing) = \\varnothing,\\]i.e. the two events \\(\\{X_n = 0\\}\\) and \\(\\{X_n = 1\\}\\) are disjoint (as expected), and their union is the sample space (this is called a partition), so the sum of the above two probabilities should be 1. (Note that here we use general properties of preimages of functions (\\(f^{-1}(A \\cup B) = f^{-1}(A) \\cup f^{-1}(B)\\), \\(f^{-1}(A \\cap B) = f^{-1}(A) \\cap f^{-1}(B)\\), and \\(f^{-1}(A \\setminus B) = f^{-1}(A) \\setminus f^{-1}(B)\\)), and when taking the preimage of a point, we often drop the curly brackets. It does not mean the inverse function; \\(X_n\\) is certainly not invertible!)Example 9 (continued from part 1). Let’s again consider the uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\), and the random variable \\(X : \\Omega \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb R, x \\mapsto x\\) defined above. Then, for example, for \\((a,b) \\subseteq (0,1)\\),\\[\\mathbb P(a &lt; X &lt; b) = \\mathbb P(X^{-1}((a,b))) = \\mathbb P((a,b)) = b - a.\\]Now, recall that the composition of measurable functions is measurable, so if \\(f\\) is for instance continuous, then \\(f(X) = f \\circ X\\) is also a random variable! Let’s take \\(f\\) to be the squaring function \\(x \\mapsto x^2\\). Let’s investigate the random variable \\(f(X) = X^2 : [0,1] \\to \\mathbb R\\) where \\(X^2(\\omega) = \\omega^2\\):Challenge question 5 (related to example 9). Find \\((X^2)^{-1}(I) \\subseteq [0,1]\\) for any open interval \\(I = (a,b) \\subseteq [0,1]\\). Is this a valid event (a Borel set in \\([0,1]\\))? Thus compute the probability \\(\\mathbb P(a &lt; X^2 &lt; b)\\). For \\(x \\in (0,1)\\), find \\((X^2)^{-1}((-\\infty,x])\\) and thus find \\(G(x) = \\mathbb P(X^2 \\leq x)\\). What is \\(G(b) - G(a)\\)? Can you find a function \\(g : (0,1) \\to \\mathbb R\\) such that \\(\\mathbb P(a &lt; X^2 &lt; b) = \\int_a^b g(x)\\,dx\\)? (Hint: consider the function \\(G : (0,1) \\to [0,1]\\), and apply the fundamental theorem of calculus, which implies \\(\\int_a^b G'(x)\\,dx = G(b) - G(a)\\).) This is (almost) the probability density function (or pdf) of \\(X^2\\).Post your solutions in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!Distributions: a change in perspectiveProbability distributions and pushforwardsA subtle but important change of perspective is to notice that for a probability measure \\(\\mathbb P\\) on the sample space, and a random variable \\(X : \\Omega \\to E\\), we can actually define a new probability measure on the state space \\(E\\), that arises naturally from \\(X\\)! This is the pushforward measure \\(\\mathbb P_X = X_*\\mathbb P = \\mathbb P \\circ X^{-1} : \\mathcal E \\to [0,1]\\), defined by\\[\\mathbb P_X(A) := \\mathbb P(X^{-1}(A)) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A).\\]Here, \\(A \\in \\mathcal E\\) is a (Borel) measurable set. Then the triple \\((E,\\mathcal E,\\mathbb P_X)\\) is a probability space, induced by the random variable \\(X\\), so we can directly talk about probabilities using only the state space! And this is crucial in defining probability distributions, as we can then largely ignore the sample space!This is something that we like to do a lot in maths: which is to start off with a structure on a set, and use a mapping to transfer that structure over to a different set. This is one such example; other examples of similar structure-preserving maps are continuous maps (preserving open sets), homeomorphisms (preserving topologies), isometries (preserving distances), linear transformations (preserving vector space structure), homomorphisms/isomorphisms (preserving algebraic structure), and pullbacks of bilinear forms under a linear map.Now, let’s consider \\((-\\infty,x]\\) which is clearly a Borel set. We define the cumulative distribution function using the probability that \\(X\\) takes on a value in this set:Definition 14. For a random variable \\(X : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb R\\), its (cumulative) distribution function (cdf) is the measurable function \\(F_X : \\mathbb R \\to [0,1]\\), defined by\\[F_X(x) = \\mathbb P(X \\leq x) = \\mathbb P(X^{-1}((-\\infty,x])) = \\mathbb P_X((-\\infty,x]).\\]That is, the cdf of \\(X\\) gives us the probability measure of the event \\((-\\infty,x]\\), where we push the probability measure from the sample space over to the state space! Similarly, if we have a probability space \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mathbb P)\\) with sample space \\(\\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb R\\), we can define the distribution function of the probability measure \\(\\mathbb P\\) as \\(F : \\mathbb R \\to [0,1]， x \\mapsto \\mathbb P((-\\infty,x])\\).As a quick note, the cdf of a random variable \\(X\\) fully determines its properties, as we may recover the event \\(X^{-1}(A) = \\{X \\in A\\}\\) (thus \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\)) for any Borel set \\(A\\) from countable unions/intersections/complements of events \\(X^{-1}((-\\infty,x]) = \\{X \\leq x\\}\\) with \\(x \\in \\mathbb R\\).It is possible to see that any cdf must be increasing (i.e. if \\(a &lt; b\\), then \\(F(a) \\leq F(b)\\)):Proof For \\(a &lt; b\\), we have\\[F(b) = \\mathbb P((-\\infty,b]) = \\mathbb P((-\\infty,a] \\cup (a,b]) = \\mathbb P((-\\infty,a]) + \\underbrace{\\mathbb P((a,b])}_{\\geq 0} \\geq F(a). \\square\\]Additionally, cdfs have countably many discontinuities, and must be right-continuous, meaning that not every increasing measurable function with codomain \\([0,1]\\) is the cdf of some random variable.This change of perspective is useful, as it allows us to define when two random variables have the same probability distribution, even when they aren’t defined on the same probability space! We say that two random variables \\(X : (\\Omega_1,\\mathcal F_1,\\mathbb P_1) \\to (\\mathbb R,\\mathcal B)\\) and \\(Y : (\\Omega_2,\\mathcal F_2,\\mathbb P_2) \\to (\\mathbb R,\\mathcal B)\\) are equal in distribution if their cdfs are equal as functions: \\(F_X = F_Y\\); this means that \\(\\mathbb P_1(X \\leq x) = \\mathbb P_2(Y \\leq x)\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb R\\) (note the different probability measures), or equivalently,\\[\\mathbb P_X((-\\infty,x]) = \\mathbb P_Y((-\\infty,x]),\\]which turns out to imply that \\(\\mathbb P_X = \\mathbb P_Y\\) (the pushforward measures) as probability measures on the state space \\((\\mathbb R,\\mathcal B)\\) (again via the Hahn-Kolmogorov theorem). And hopefully this explains why the pushforward measure is so important: \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) have the same probability distribution if and only if they induce identical probability spaces on the event space (via the pushforward measure), even if they are defined on totally different sample spaces.Furthermore, this change in perspective allows us to “discard” the sample space, and instead consider a probability measure on the state space \\(\\mathbb R\\), in the sense that if \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mathbb P)\\) is a probability space and \\(X : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb R\\) is a random variable with pushforward measure \\(\\mathbb P_X\\), we ignore this and work only with the probability space \\((\\mathbb R,\\mathcal B,\\mathbb P_X)\\), and we consider the properties of this probability space (expectation, density, etc.). This is the usual approach to learning random variables in early studies – do you ever remember thinking about the sample space when working with random variables? Most likely not.Examples of distributionsExample 15. Lets see an example of this, coming from our previous examples. Consider the first probability space to be the example with rolling two fair dice (independently) with \\(\\Omega_1 = \\{1,...,6\\} \\times \\{1,...,6\\}\\), and the second probability space be the uniform distribution on \\(\\Omega_2 = [0,1]\\). Clearly these random variables are vastly different. Define the random variable \\(X : \\Omega_1 \\to \\mathbb R\\) as giving \\(1\\) if the first die resulted in an equal or higher roll than the second, or \\(0\\) otherwise:\\[X(\\omega) = X((\\omega_1,\\omega_2)) = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; \\omega_1 \\geq \\omega_2 \\\\ 0, &amp; \\omega_1 &lt; \\omega_2 \\end{cases}\\]Let \\(Y : \\Omega_2 \\to \\mathbb R\\) be given by the following transformation:\\[Y(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; \\omega \\leq 21/36 \\\\ 0, &amp; \\omega &gt; 21/36 \\end{cases}\\]Let’s compute the cdfs of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). For \\(X\\), for any \\(x \\in (-\\infty,0)\\), we have \\(X^{-1}((-\\infty,x]) = \\varnothing\\), so \\(F_X(x) = \\mathbb P_X((-\\infty,x]) = \\mathbb P_1(\\varnothing) = 0\\). For \\(x \\in [0,1)\\), \\(X^{-1}((-\\infty,x]) = X^{-1}(0) = \\{(\\omega_1,\\omega_2) \\in \\Omega_1 : \\omega_1 \\geq \\omega_2\\}\\), so\\[F_X(x) = \\mathbb P_X((-\\infty,x]) = \\mathbb P_1(\\{(\\omega_1,\\omega_2) \\in \\Omega_1 : \\omega_1 \\geq \\omega_2\\}) = \\frac{21}{36}\\]by a simple combinatorial argument, and the fact that the 21 outcomes in that event are equiprobable. Now for \\(x \\in [1,\\infty)\\), \\(X^{-1}((-\\infty,x]) = X^{-1}(\\{0,1\\}) = \\Omega_1\\), so \\(F_X(x) = \\mathbb P_X((-\\infty,x]) = \\mathbb P_1(\\Omega_1) = 1\\). In summary:\\[F_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 0, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\\\ 21/36, &amp; 0 \\leq x &lt; 1 \\\\ 1, &amp; x \\geq 1 \\end{cases}\\]Challenge question 6 (related to example 15). Compute the cdf of \\(Y\\), and show that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are equal in distribution. (This then implies \\(\\mathbb P_X = \\mathbb P_Y\\) and \\(\\mathbb P_1(X \\in A) = \\mathbb P_2(Y \\in A)\\) for any Borel set \\(A\\), and we may as well forget about the original sample spaces and consider the abstract properties of their common induced probability space on \\(\\mathbb R\\)!) If you need a reminder of how \\((\\Omega_2,\\mathcal F_2,\\mathbb P_2)\\) works, the example is Example 9 in here.At this point, we are finally ready to define discrete and continuous random variables, or more fundamentally, probability distributions.Definition 16. A continuous random variable \\(X : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb R\\) is such that \\(\\mathbb P(X = x) = \\mathbb P_X(\\{x\\}) = 0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb R\\). An absolutely continuous random variable \\(X : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb R\\) is such that there exists a function \\(f : \\mathbb R \\to [0,\\infty]\\) such that \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A) = \\int_A f(x)\\,dx\\) for any Borel set \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb R\\). This function \\(f\\) is the probability density function (density/pdf) of \\(X\\). (Absolutely continuous random variables are continuous.) A discrete random variable \\(X : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb R\\) is such that there exists a countable Borel set \\(A\\) with \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A) = \\mathbb P_X(A) = 1\\). (If \\(\\Omega\\) is discrete, any random variable will be discrete.)Note how densities are defined. We start with a probability space, with a probability measure \\(\\mathbb P\\) defined on it, and a random variable \\(X\\) mapping the sample space into the reals. A density is then a function that satisfies the particular property that\\[\\mathbb P(X \\in A) = \\mathbb P_X(A) = \\int_A f(x)\\,dx\\]for any Borel set \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb R\\), which may feel backwards. Don’t we usually start with the density function? We can, and again this approach uses the idea that we can forget about the original sample space, and study the probability space via the pushforward measure. So when we gave the normal density\\[f_\\theta : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\quad x \\mapsto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\]at the start of part 1, we can either think of a probability space and a random variable which happens to have this as a density, or we can think of this density as characterising the pushforward measure of some random variable whose sample space is unimportant. And it is this second perspective that we tend to prefer, as the analysis (probability calculations, expectation/moments, statistics, etc.) then directly applies to any scenario in which the pushforward measure has the same density, even if the underlying experiment is different (as we saw in Example 15).Next up, to tackle the problem of unifying the concepts of densities and expectations of different types of distributions, we will consider a new form of integral: the Lebesgue integral. We leave this to the next part of this series!" }, { "title": "Why probability and statistics need measure theory, part 1", "url": "/posts/measure-theory-in-probability/", "categories": "Epic Maths Time, New Perspectives", "tags": "probability, measure-theory, statistics, topology, uni-maths, maths, highlights", "date": "2021-06-16 21:57:00 +1000", "snippet": "Introduction to the problemYou may have encountered continuous probability distributions such as the normal distribution.

It’s often used to model things in the real world, and has nice statistical properties. You know the bell curve. But what you may not have seen is its formula: the probability density function (often shortened to just density),\\[f_\\theta : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\quad x \\mapsto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\]given a value of \\(\\theta = (\\mu,\\sigma^2) \\in \\Theta\\). In our case, \\(\\Theta = \\mathbb{R} \\times (0,\\infty)\\); this is known as the parameter space, and this is central to the study of statistics.How does this relate to probability? Well, everything. We begin informally: suppose that \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable with density \\(f_\\theta\\). The meaning of this is unimportant initially; think of \\(X\\) as a “variable” that takes on values randomly (we will see that this is very much not a random variable should be). For a “reasonable” subset \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\), let \\(\\mathbb{P}(X \\in A)\\) denote the probability that \\(X \\in A\\), i.e. the probability of the event \\(\\{X \\in A\\}\\) (whatever that means). It turns out that, and as is often taught in a class in probability (even at high school level),\\[\\mathbb P(X \\in A) = \\int_A f_\\theta(x)\\,dx = \\int_A \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\,dx.\\]In fact, we are kind of working backwards. The probability density function is essentially defined to be a function such that integrating it over the desired subset yields the probability of \\(X\\) taking on a value in that set. We get a couple of questions: How does the probability-assignment process work? What should \\(A\\) be allowed to be? Should we allow every subset of the reals? In particular, if \\(A = \\{x_0\\}\\) for some \\(x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), the previous formula implies that \\(\\mathbb P(X = x_0) = 0\\), as an integral over a point. Does that make sense? Does that mean the event \\(\\{X = x_0\\}\\) is impossible? (It turns out it is possible!) Also, what about the seemingly irreconcilable differences between continuous and discrete probability distributions (density vs mass, expectation formulas, the general vibe, etc.)?It turns out that measure theory has the answer to all of these questions.Some measure theory, with a probabilistic flavourTopologies and sigma algebrasMeasure theory is essentially the theory of assigning sizes to sets, done rigorously. We will motivate probability spaces, which are measure spaces in which the “total size” is 1. But first, we define a topology; it turns out that it is intimately related to measures. (Warning: this subsection is rather technical, so feel free to skim over it; it’s mostly here for background.)Definition 1. Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a set, called the sample space in our context. A topology on \\(\\Omega\\) is a collection \\(\\tau\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) satisfying the following properties: (Whole and empty set) The whole and empty sets are elements of the topology: \\(\\Omega \\in \\tau\\) and \\(\\varnothing \\in \\tau\\); (Closure under arbitrary unions) For an indexed collection of sets \\((A_i)_{i \\in I}\\) with each \\(A_i \\in \\tau\\) (finite or infinite), their union \\(\\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i \\in \\tau\\) also; (Closure under finite intersections) For a finite collection of sets \\(A_1,A_2,...,A_n\\) with each \\(A_i \\in \\tau\\), their intersection \\(\\bigcap_{i = 1}^n A_i \\in \\tau\\) also.If \\(\\tau\\) is a topology on \\(\\Omega\\), then the pair \\((\\Omega,\\tau)\\) is a topological space, and the elements in the topology (subsets of \\(\\Omega\\)) are called open sets. A set \\(B\\) is closed if \\(\\Omega \\setminus B\\) is open.Yes, this is the topology in which donuts are the same as (homeomorphic to) coffee mugs!Let’s look at a simple example of a topological space: the usual one \\((\\mathbb{R},\\tau)\\) on the reals. We define it via the open sets: a subset \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) is open if, for each point \\(a \\in A\\), there is an open interval \\(I = (a - \\epsilon,a + \\epsilon)\\) (with \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\)) centred at \\(a\\) that is wholly contained in \\(A\\), i.e. \\(I \\subseteq A\\). For example, the set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is open: for \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), we have \\((a - 1,a + 1) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\). Additionally, the set \\((0,1)\\) is open: for \\(a \\in (0,1)\\), let \\(\\epsilon = \\min(a,1 - a) \\leq a,1 - a\\); note that \\(0 = a - a \\leq a - \\epsilon\\) and \\(a + \\epsilon \\leq a + (1 - a) = 1\\), so \\((a - \\epsilon,a + \\epsilon) \\subseteq (0,1)\\). However, the set \\([0,1)\\) is not open: at \\(a = 0\\), every open interval centred at \\(0\\) goes “outside” of \\((0,1)\\). From these, we see that \\(\\mathbb R \\setminus \\mathbb R = \\varnothing\\) and \\(\\mathbb R \\setminus (0,1) = (-\\infty,0] \\cup [1,\\infty)\\) are closed. A similar argument shows that \\([0,1]\\) is closed (its complement is open); this suggests that the intervals that are open sets are precisely the open intervals \\((a,b)\\), and those that are closed sets are precisely the closed intervals \\([a,b]\\) (where we allow infinity and \\(a = b\\)).Now back to our question: which sets can we talk about probabilities of? Suppose that we only allowed open and closed sets. Then sets as simple as \\([0,1)\\) would be disallowed, but it seems quite reasonable to talk about the probability of \\(\\{0 \\leq X &lt; 1\\}\\)! Thus we introduce sigma algebras:Definition 2. Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a set, called the sample space in our context. A sigma algebra (of sets) on \\(\\Omega\\) is a collection \\(\\mathcal F\\) of subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) satisfying the following properties: (Whole and empty set) The whole and empty sets are elements of the sigma algebra: \\(\\Omega \\in \\mathcal F\\) and \\(\\varnothing \\in \\mathcal F\\) (we may omit one of these); (Closure under countable unions) For a countable collection of sets \\((A_i)_{i = 1}^\\infty\\) with each \\(A_i \\in \\mathcal F\\), their union \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i \\in \\mathcal F\\) also; (Closure under complements) If \\(A \\in \\mathcal F\\), then its complement \\(A^c := \\Omega \\setminus A \\in \\mathcal F\\).If \\(\\mathcal F\\) is a sigma algebra on \\(\\Omega\\), then the pair \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F)\\) is a measurable space, and the elements in the sigma algebra (subsets of \\(\\Omega\\)) are called measurable sets; in the context of probability, we call them events.Note that by de Morgan’s laws, we also have closure under countable intersections: if \\(A_1,A_2,... \\in \\mathcal F\\), then \\(A_1^c,A_2^c,... \\in \\mathcal F\\); then \\(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i^c = \\left(\\bigcap_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i\\right)^c \\in \\mathcal F\\), so its complement \\(\\bigcap_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i \\in \\mathcal F\\).Now, what’s an example of a sigma algebra on the reals? For this, essentially take our standard topology from above, and just force it to be a sigma algebra: this gives the Borel sigma algebra.Definition 3. Let \\((\\Omega,\\tau)\\) be a topological space. The Borel sigma algebra \\(\\mathcal B = \\mathcal B(\\tau)\\) is the (smallest) sigma algebra generated by \\(\\tau\\), formed from a countable number of unions, intersections, and complements of open sets in \\(\\Omega\\). Elements of \\(\\mathcal B\\) are then called Borel sets.For example, \\([0,1)\\) is a Borel set. Why? Notice that \\([0,1) = [(-\\infty,0) \\cup [1,\\infty)]^c\\). Since \\((-\\infty,0)\\) is open, it must be a Borel set (as the Borel sigma algebra contains the topology). Also, since \\((-\\infty,1)\\) is open, it too is a Borel set; its complement \\([1,\\infty)\\) is then a Borel set (by property 3 of sigma algebras). Then \\((-\\infty,0) \\cup [1,\\infty)\\) is a Borel set as a countable union of Borel sets. Finally, its complement \\([0,1)\\) is a Borel set, as claimed.Challenge exercise 1: using a similar approach, prove that the set of irrational numbers is a Borel set. (Hint: at some point, you may want to consider a union of singleton sets \\(\\{x_0\\}\\) for certain \\(x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).) Post your solutions in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!Almost any “reasonable” set you can think of will (almost surely, with probability 1!) be a Borel set (come up with your own examples and prove it), and these turn out to be precisely one broad class of sets \\(A\\) for which it makes sense to talk about the probability of the event \\(\\{X \\in A\\}\\). Now it’s time to tie this all back to probability. But to do so, we may as well (finally, for some of you) define probability rigorously…Measure and probability spacesWe define a way to assign “sizes” to measurable sets. This is the essence of measure theory.Definition 4. A measure on a measurable space \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F)\\) is a function \\(\\mu : \\mathcal F \\to [0,\\infty]\\) (yes, we include infinity), satisfying: (Null empty set) \\(\\mu(\\varnothing) = 0\\); (Countable additivity) If \\((A_i)_{i = 1}^\\infty\\) is a countable sequence of pairwise disjoint sets (i.e. \\(A_i \\cap A_j = \\varnothing\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\)), then\\(\\mu\\left(\\bigcup_{i = 1}^\\infty A_i\\right) = \\sum_{i = 1}^\\infty \\mu(A_i)\\).Then \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mu)\\) is a measure space. If we add the additional property that \\(\\mu(\\Omega) = 1\\), then \\(\\mu\\) is a probability measure, and \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mu)\\) is a probability space. (In this case, we usually write \\(\\mathbb P\\) instead of \\(\\mu\\), so that \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mathbb P)\\) is a probability space; here, \\(\\mathcal F\\) is the event space, and its elements are events.) Definition 4 (plus unit measure) is often presented as the Kolmogorov axioms for probability, covered in many (good) courses on probability at university.For example, the Lebesgue measure \\(\\lambda\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is a way to assign lengths to subsets of the reals in a sensible way: \\(\\lambda((0,1)) = \\lambda([0,1]) = 1\\), \\(\\lambda((0,1) \\cup (3,5]) = 3\\), \\(\\lambda(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}) = \\lambda(\\mathbb{N}) = \\lambda(\\mathbb{Q}) = 0\\), \\(\\lambda(\\mathbb{R}) = \\lambda(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}) = \\infty\\), etc. However, not every subset of \\(\\mathbb R\\) can be sensibly assigned a Lebesgue measure. And this is the entire point of measure theory and sigma algebras: if we did try to assign a measure to every subset, we get contradictions. And it turns out that in probability, we run into the exact same issues. When we use the usual Borel sigma algebra on the reals, we run into no such issues (intuitively because the topology is very nice, and thus the sigma algebra it contains sufficiently nice sets), and we thus stick with it.But now we turn our attention back to probability spaces. Let’s unpack this definition, at least for probability measures. Firstly, a probability is a function from the event space to \\([0,\\infty]\\) (in fact, we can see that its codomain is \\([0,1]\\), by the other properties). The probability of the empty set must be 0; this makes sense, as we always expect some outcome to occur in an experiment. The probability of the sample space is 1; again this makes sense, as the sample space is the set of all outcomes. Finally, the key property of probability is that for a (countable) sequence of pairwise disjoint events, often called mutually exclusive events, the probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities. Again, this is intuitive from elementary probability: if two events can’t happen simultaneously, we should be able to add their probabilities to get the probability of their union.Let’s firstly try our hand at proving some simple results we know from probability, using our new axioms! Let \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mathbb P)\\) be any probability space.Proposition 5. For disjoint (mutually exclusive) \\(A,B \\in \\mathcal F\\), we have \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B)\\).Proof. Observe that the sequence \\(A,B,\\varnothing,\\varnothing,...\\) is such that any two events are pairwise disjoint. Then using property 2 of measures,\\[\\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A \\cup B \\cup \\varnothing \\cup \\dotsb) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) + \\mathbb P(\\varnothing) + \\dotsb = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B),\\]where we use the fact that \\(\\mathbb P(\\varnothing) = 0\\), i.e. property 1 of measures. \\(\\square\\)Proposition 6. For \\(A \\in \\mathcal F\\), we have \\(\\mathbb P(A^c) = 1 - \\mathbb P(A)\\).Proof. Observe that \\(A,A^c\\) are disjoint, and \\(A \\cup A^c = \\Omega\\). Then by Proposition 5,\\[1 = \\mathbb P(\\Omega) = \\mathbb P(A \\cup A^c) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(A^c),\\]so \\(\\mathbb P(A^c) = 1 - \\mathbb P(A)\\), as claimed. \\(\\square\\)Challenge question 2.1. Prove that for any \\(A,B \\in \\mathcal F\\) (not necessarily disjoint), we have \\(\\mathbb P(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb P(A) + \\mathbb P(B) - \\mathbb P(A \\cap B)\\). (Hint: decompose \\(A \\cup B\\) into two disjoint events in \\(\\mathcal F\\).)Challenge question 2.2 (conditional probability). Fix \\(E \\in \\mathcal F\\) with \\(\\mathbb P(E) \\neq 0\\), where \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal F,\\mathbb P)\\) is a probability space. Consider the collection of sets \\(\\mathcal F_E := \\{E \\cap A : A \\in \\mathcal F\\}\\). Show that \\(\\mathcal F_E\\) is a sigma algebra on \\(E\\). Define a function \\(\\mathbb P_E : \\mathcal F_E \\to [0,1]\\) by\\(\\mathbb P_E(B) = \\frac{\\mathbb P(B)}{\\mathbb P(E)}.\\)Show that this is a probability measure on \\((E,\\mathcal F_E)\\), i.e. \\((E,\\mathcal F_E,\\mathbb P_E)\\) is a probability space.Note that \\(B \\in \\mathcal F_E\\) means that \\(B = A \\cap E\\) for some \\(A \\in \\mathcal F\\), so \\(\\mathbb P_E(B) = \\frac{\\mathbb P(A \\cap E)}{\\mathbb P(E)}\\); we often use the notation \\(\\mathbb P(A \\mid E) = \\mathbb P_E(A \\cap E)\\). This is called conditional probability: essentially, we restrict our event space to events that intersect the conditioning event \\(E\\), and reweight all probabilities so that we still have a valid probability measure (with \\(\\mathbb P_E(E) = 1\\)).Examples of probability spacesNote that the probability measure \\(\\mathbb P\\) is extremely abstract: once we have decided on a sample space, that is, a set of possible outcomes, any function \\(\\mathbb{P} : \\mathcal F \\to [0,1]\\) satisfying the above properties of a measure, defines a “probability” on \\(\\Omega\\). This probability may range from something usual, to something wild. We consider a few simple examples:Example 7 (rolling two independent fair dice). Here, a possible sample space is \\(\\Omega = \\{1,...,6\\} \\times \\{1,...,6\\}\\), i.e. ordered pairs of numbers in \\(1,...,6\\). This naturally encodes the outcome of a sequence of two dice rolls. Now what are the valid events? Since the sample space has \\(36\\) elements (and is finite), we may take \\(\\mathcal F = \\mathcal P(\\Omega)\\), the power set of the sample space; that is, every subset of \\(\\Omega\\) is a valid event. (You can check that this is indeed a sigma algebra on \\(\\Omega\\). How many events are there in total?)Now we consider the probability measure \\(\\mathbb P : \\mathcal F \\to [0,1]\\). Note that every event \\(A\\) is a (countable) union of individual outcomes \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\). By our assumption of fairness and independence (which gives symmetry), each of the 36 possible outcomes is assigned a measure of \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\), so that \\(\\mathbb P(\\Omega) = 1\\). Thus, for \\(A \\in \\mathcal F\\), its probability depends only on its cardinality: in fact,\\[\\mathbb P(A) = \\mathbb P\\left(\\bigcup_{\\omega \\in A} \\{\\omega\\}\\right) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in A} \\mathbb P(\\{\\omega\\}) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in A} \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{|A|}{36};\\]this fully specifies the probability space in this experiment. (Note that in this derivation, we assumed that \\(\\mathbb P\\) was a probability measure, to get countable additivity.)Example 8 (independently tossing a sequence of coins). Here, a possible sample space is \\(\\{0,1\\}^\\infty\\), the space of infinite sequences with terms in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\), where we may associate \\(0\\) with a tails, and \\(1\\) with a heads. In this case, an appropriate event space \\(\\mathcal F\\) is more complicated. For a finite binary string \\(b = b_1\\dotsb b_n\\), define\\[A_b = \\{(b_1,b_2,...,b_n,x_{n+1},x_{n+2},...) : x_{n+1},x_{n+2},... \\in \\{0,1\\}\\}.\\]Then for natural \\(n \\geq 0\\), define \\(\\mathcal F_n := \\{\\varnothing,\\Omega\\} \\cup \\{A_b : b\\ \\text{is a binary string of length at most}\\ n\\}\\). For example, \\(\\mathcal F_2 := \\{\\varnothing,\\Omega,A_0,A_1,A_{00},A_{01},A_{10},A_{11}\\}\\). Define \\(\\mathcal F\\) as the smallest sigma algebra containing \\(\\bigcup_{n = 0}^\\infty \\mathcal F_n\\) (the union turns out to not be a sigma algebra, as seen here). We need this construction, instead of the entire power set of \\(\\Omega\\), as there turn out to be subsets of \\(\\Omega\\) that cannot be assigned a measure in a way that agrees with our definition!Now suppose that for each toss, a head appears with probability \\(p \\in (0,1)\\). For integer \\(n \\geq 1\\), let \\(B_n\\) be the event that the first head is tossed on the \\(n\\)th toss: then\\[B_n = \\{(\\underbrace{0,0,...,0,1}_{n\\ \\text{tosses}},x_{n+1},x_{n+2},...) : x_{n+1},x_{n+2},... \\in \\{0,1\\}\\};\\]this is precisely the event \\(A_{00\\dotsb 1}\\) defined above, so we know that \\(B_n\\) is a valid event (i.e. \\(B_n \\in \\mathcal F\\)), by construction.Challenge question 3 (related to example 8). If a random variable \\(X\\) is defined on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^+\\) such that the event \\(\\{X = n\\} = B_n\\) (i.e. \\(\\mathbb P(X = n) = \\mathbb P(B_n)\\)): What is the well-known distribution of \\(X\\)? Thus, what should \\(\\mathbb P\\) assign to this event \\(B_n\\)? Show that each singleton set (containing a single sequence of tosses) is in the event space, so that it makes sense to talk about its probability. What is this probability of any individual sequence \\(\\omega = (x_1,x_2,...)\\) of tosses in \\(B_n\\)? Is \\(\\mathbb P(B_n) = \\mathbb P\\left(\\bigcup_{\\omega \\in B_n} \\{\\omega\\}\\right) = \\sum_{\\omega \\in B_n} \\mathbb P(\\{\\omega\\})\\), and is this a contradiction, since the \\(B_n\\) are pairwise disjoint and we expect the probability of the union to be the sum of the probabilities? (Hint: what is \\(\\lvert B_n \\rvert\\)? Can you show that it is uncountable? Consider Cantor’s diagonalisation argument.)Post your solutions in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!In this previous example, we saw an example of an event with probability 0, but is certainly possible: of course, the event of any particular sequence of heads/tails is a possible outcome.Example 9 (uniform distribution on unit interval). In this example, \\(\\Omega = [0,1]\\). Imagine randomly selecting a number in \\([0,1]\\); random number generators do this (pseudorandomly) all the time. What is the probability of getting a particular number \\(\\omega \\in [0,1]\\)? (We’ll answer this later.) Let’s firstly consider the event space. It turns out the power set of \\([0,1]\\) is too big (we cannot define a probability measure on it); this is where we use the Borel sigma algebra! Recall the Borel sets in \\(\\mathbb R\\). We say that \\(A \\subseteq [0,1]\\) is a Borel set (in \\([0,1]\\)) if it is a Borel set in \\(\\mathbb R\\), under the usual topology (open sets contain open intervals about every point). So \\(\\mathcal F = \\mathcal B\\); for example, \\([0,1],(0,1),(1/2,3/4),\\mathbb Q \\cap [0,1]\\) are all valid events.We define \\(\\mathbb P : \\mathcal F \\to [0,1]\\) in a natural way: for any open interval \\(I = (a,b) \\subseteq [0,1]\\), we define \\(\\mathbb P(I) = b - a\\). Moreover, define \\(\\mathbb P([0,a)) = a\\) and \\(\\mathbb P((a,1]) = 1 - a\\) for \\(a \\in (0,1)\\). This then extends to all the other Borel sets via the properties of a probability measure (invoking the Hahn-Kolmogorov theorem). The intuition behind this is that probability should be proportional to the length/size, or Lebesgue measure, of the set. For example, the probability of \\(A = \\{0,1/2\\}\\) is \\(0\\): \\(A^c = (0,1/2) \\cup (1/2,1]\\). We defined \\(\\mathbb P((0,1/2)) = \\mathbb P((1/2,1]) = 1/2\\). Therefore,\\[\\mathbb P(A^c) = \\mathbb P\\left(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cup \\left(\\frac{1}{2},1\\right]\\right) = \\mathbb P\\left(\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) + \\mathbb P\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2},1\\right]\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1,\\]meaning that \\(\\mathbb P(A) = 0\\). Again, this is an event that is possible (we can pick \\(0\\) or \\(1/2\\) randomly, but the probability is \\(0\\).)As another example, we compute \\(\\mathbb P(\\mathbb A \\cap \\Omega)\\), where \\(\\mathbb A \\subseteq \\mathbb C\\) is the set of algebraic numbers, i.e. roots of polynomials with integer coefficients. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a degree \\(n\\) polynomial has at most \\(n\\) roots. By identifying the degree-\\(n\\) polynomial \\(p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\dotsb + a_nx^n \\in \\mathbb Z[x]\\) with the sequence \\((a_0,a_1,...,a_n) \\in \\mathbb Z^n\\) and taking a union over all \\(n \\in \\mathbb N\\), it is possible to see that the set of polynomials \\(\\mathbb Z[x]\\) with integral coefficients is countable. Thus there are at most a countable number of algebraic numbers (by counting the roots as you count these polynomials). As shown in the following challenge question, \\(\\mathbb P(\\{x\\}) = 0\\) for any \\(x \\in [0,1]\\). Since \\(\\mathbb A \\cap \\Omega\\) is a countable union of such singleton sets, it follows by countable additivity that \\(\\mathbb P(\\mathbb A \\cap \\Omega) = 0\\).Challenge question 4 (related to example 9). Show, using only the properties of a probability measure, that for any \\(x \\in [0,1]\\), \\(\\mathbb P(\\{x\\}) = 0\\). Thus show that \\(\\mathbb P([a,b]) = b - a\\) for closed intervals \\([a,b] \\subseteq [0,1]\\) with \\(a \\neq 0\\) and \\(b \\neq 1\\) (although it is true for those too). It is known that \\(B = \\sin^2(\\mathbb N) = \\{\\sin^2(n) : n \\in \\mathbb N\\}\\) (where \\(0 \\in \\mathbb N\\)) is dense in \\([0,1]\\) (meaning that you can find points in \\(B\\) within any (possibly arbitrary small) open subinterval of \\([0,1]\\)); find the probability that you do not randomly choose a number in \\(B\\), i.e. \\(\\mathbb P(\\Omega \\setminus B)\\).Post your solutions in the unofficial Maths @ Monash Discord!We’ve now had quite a bit of experience with probability spaces, and maybe you can start to appreciate the role of measure theory in probability! Now we are finally ready, and will attempt to answer the age-old question: what is a random variable? Check out the next post for the answers!" } ]
