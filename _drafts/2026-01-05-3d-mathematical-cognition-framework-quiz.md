This page presents the final, refined version of the three-dimensional framework for mathematical cognition. It includes:

- Definitions of the three axes
- The complete set of 15 archetypes with explanations and coordinates
- The final 15-question weighted diagnostic quiz

## 1. The 3 Axes

Mathematical cognition is modelled as a point in a three-dimensional space:

### 1.1 Structure ↔ Intuition (S/I)

Structure (-10): Prefers definitions, formalism, equivalences, symbolic clarity, and mechanistic reasoning.

Intuition (+10): Prefers pictures, analogies, geometric reasoning, and gestalt understanding.

### 1.2 Behaviour ↔ Abstraction (B/A)

Behaviour (-10): Focuses on step-by-step behaviour, operations, algorithms, and concrete mechanisms.

Abstraction (+10): Prefers general principles, conceptual unification, axiomatic characterisations, and universal properties.

### 1.3 Discrete ↔ Continuous (D/C)

Discrete (-10): Thinks in finite, combinatorial, algebraic, or stepwise structures.

Continuous (+10): Thinks in smooth, geometric, analytic, or limit-based structures.

## 2. Archetypes in the 3D Space

Each archetype corresponds to a region of the cube. Coordinates are approximate centres.

### 2.1 Structural / Abstract / Discrete Region

Structural Conceptualist (Discrete) -- $(-10,\ +5,\ -8)$  
Seeks structural clarity and conceptual unification within discrete worlds.

Algebraic Mechanist -- $(-10,\ +2,\ -8)$  
Mechanism-focused but grounded in algebraic structure.

Conceptual Algebraist -- $(-8,\ +6,\ -6)$  
Abstract thinker who prefers algebraic and structural viewpoints.

Structural Combinatorialist -- $(-9,\ +1,\ -9)$  
Works in finite or combinatorial settings with strong structural preferences.

Discrete Structural Analyst -- $(-7,\ +3,\ -9)$  
Discrete thinker who uses structural and analytic tools.

### 2.2 Structural / Abstract / Continuous Region

Abstract Structuralist -- $(-9,\ +10,\ -3)$  
Highly abstract, structural, and comfortable with both discrete and continuous tools.

Continuous Structuralist -- $(-8,\ +3,\ +7)$  
Structural thinker who works in continuous settings.

Analyst Monk -- $(-7,\ +9,\ +7)$  
Axiomatic, abstract, and continuous-focused.

### 2.3 Structural / Behavioural Region

Operational Structuralist -- $(-6,\ -4,\ -6)$  
Prefers procedures and mechanisms but within a structural framework.

Applied Mechanic -- $(+5,\ -8,\ +7)$  
Behaviour-first, intuition-driven, continuous thinker.

### 2.4 Intuition / Continuous Region

Geometric Intuitionist -- $(+8,\ -3,\ +9)$  
Visual, geometric, and continuous.

Continuous Intuitionist -- $(+5,\ +7,\ +8)$  
Conceptual and geometric with strong continuous intuition.

### 2.5 Intuition / Discrete Region

Combinatorial Intuitionist -- $(+3,\ -3,\ -9)$  
Intuition-driven combinatorial thinker.

### 2.6 Balanced / Mixed Region

Pattern-Driven Generalist -- $(0,\ 0,\ 0)$  
Flexible, adaptable, and comfortable across modes.

## 3. The 15-Question Weighted Diagnostic Quiz

Each question targets exactly one axis. Options:

- A = -w  
- B = 0  
- C = +w  

Each axis has 5 questions with weights summing to 10.

### 3.1 Structure ↔ Intuition (weights: 3, 3, 2, 1, 1)

Q1 (3): When you encounter a new idea, what's your first move?  
A. Pin down the exact definition (e.g., precise terms)  
B. Get a rough sense (e.g., general idea)  
C. Form an intuitive picture (e.g., mental image)

Q2 (3): What makes an explanation feel satisfying?  
A. Precision (e.g., exact details)  
B. A mix (e.g., some details and some intuition)  
C. A strong intuitive picture (e.g., clear mental image)

Q3 (2): When stuck, what helps you most?  
A. Re-examining definitions (e.g., formal review)  
B. Trying different approaches (e.g., experimenting)  
C. Visualising (e.g., imagining scenarios)

Q4 (1): Which style feels more natural?  
A. Symbolic/algebraic (e.g., formulas)  
B. Depends (e.g., varies by problem)  
C. Geometric/spatial (e.g., shapes)

Q5 (1): What do you trust most?  
A. Formal structure (e.g., logical steps)  
B. Balance (e.g., both logic and intuition)  
C. Intuitive feel (e.g., overall sense)

### 3.2 Behaviour ↔ Abstraction (weights: 3, 3, 2, 1, 1)

Q6 (3): When understanding a method, what do you focus on?  
A. Step-by-step behaviour (e.g., procedures)  
B. Examples (e.g., sample cases)  
C. General principle (e.g., overarching idea)

Q7 (3): What feels most rewarding?  
A. Tracking transformations (e.g., following steps)  
B. Seeing patterns (e.g., recurring themes)  
C. Proving a unifying theorem (e.g., broad concept)

Q8 (2): What frustrates you most?  
A. Hidden mechanisms (e.g., unclear steps)  
B. Too many examples (e.g., repetitive cases)  
C. Too specific (e.g., lacks generality)

Q9 (1): When learning something new, you prefer:  
A. A concrete procedure (e.g., how-to steps)  
B. A mix (e.g., some concrete, some abstract)  
C. An abstract characterisation (e.g., formal definition)

Q10 (1): When comparing ideas, you look for:  
A. Behavioural differences (e.g., operational contrasts)  
B. Example-based differences (e.g., case comparisons)  
C. Conceptual relationships (e.g., structural links)

### 3.3 Discrete ↔ Continuous (weights: 3, 3, 2, 1, 1)

Q11 (3): Which kind of object feels more natural?  
A. Finite/combinatorial (e.g., distinct pieces)  
B. Hybrid (e.g., mix of types)  
C. Smooth/continuous (e.g., flowing shapes)

Q12 (3): What kind of reasoning feels more comfortable?  
A. Stepwise/algorithmic (e.g., discrete steps)  
B. Depends (e.g., varies by context)  
C. Limit-based/analytic (e.g., continuous limits)

Q13 (2): Which difficulty feels more fair?  
A. Many cases/steps (e.g., discrete challenges)  
B. Mixed challenges (e.g., combination)  
C. Limits/continuity (e.g., analytic challenges)

Q14 (1): Which feels more elegant?  
A. Combinatorial/algebraic trick (e.g., discrete methods)

Q15 (1): Which world feels more home-like?  
A. Finite/algebraic/combinatorial (e.g., discrete settings)  
B. Both (e.g., flexible)  
C. Smooth/geometric/analytic (e.g., continuous settings)

## 4. Scoring

For each question:

- A = -w
- B = 0
- C = +w

Axis scores:

- S/I = Q1--Q5
- B/A = Q6--Q10
- D/C = Q11--Q15

Final coordinate:

$$ (S/I,\ B/A,\ D/C) \in [-10,10]^3 $$

This coordinate determines the nearest archetype.
