## 1. Truthfulness -- 'I will be clear, honest, and grounded in reality.'

**Commitments:**

- I will not distort, euphemise or obscure the truth in my work.
- I will communicate with clarity, whether I'm writing analysis, advice, or cultural messaging.
- I will name issues accurately -- operational, relational or ethical -- in the spaces I steward.
- I will resist the drift toward vague language when precision is needed.
- I will let integrity shape my advice, even when the system prefers ambiguity.

**Why this matters:**

Truthfulness is not confrontation. It's stewardship. It ensures decisions are made on solid ground.

**Scripture references:**

- **Proverbs 12:22**
  > 'The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in those who tell the truth.'
  
  This verse highlights God's abhorrence of falsehood and delight in integrity, calling believers to embody truth as a reflection of God's nature.

- **John 8:32**
  > 'Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'
  
  Jesus reveals truth as liberating, freeing from sin and falsehood through union with Him, the incarnate Truth.

- **Ephesians 4:15**
  > 'Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.'

  Truth spoken in love fosters spiritual maturity and unity, balancing honesty with compassion.

- **Psalm 15:2**
  > 'Whoever walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks the truth in his heart.'

  Integrity flows from a pure heart aligned with God's righteousness, shaping sincere relationships and faithful living.

## 2. Presence -- 'I will stay human in a system that often forgets to be.'

**Commitments:**

- I will bring warmth, care and attentiveness into my work, even when tasks are technical.
- I will notice the human impact of decisions, processes and messaging.
- I will honour colleagues' experiences, especially when they are vulnerable or unseen.
- I will let compassion inform my instincts, not fear or institutional inertia.
- I will be a steadying presence in moments of confusion, tension, or harm.

**Why this matters:**

Presence is not softness. It's leadership. It builds trust in environments that can feel impersonal.

**Scripture references:**

- **Exodus 34:6**
  > 'The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and truth.'

  This verse reveals God's character as patient and loving, setting the model for human compassion. It calls us to embody steadfast love and grace in our presence with others.

- **Matthew 9:36**
  > 'When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.'

  Jesus' compassion is active and empathetic, showing care for the vulnerable and guiding with a shepherd's heart.

- **1 Peter 5:2--3**
  > 'Be shepherds of God's flock that is among you, watching over them... not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.'

  This passage calls leaders to servant leadership, emphasising care and example rather than control or domination.

- **Ephesians 4:32**
  > 'Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.'

  Kindness and forgiveness reflect the reconciling work of Christ, encouraging a community marked by empathy and grace.

## 3. Humility -- 'I will accept limits without letting them harden me.'

**Commitments:**

- I will recognise what is within my authority and what is not.
- I will offer my best advice, then release outcomes I cannot control.
- I will accept institutional constraints without becoming cynical or withdrawn.
- I will let disappointment refine my discernment, not calcify my heart.
- I will grow influence through trust, consistency and character -- not force.

**Why this matters:**

Humility keeps you tender. Tenderness keeps you faithful.

**Scripture references:**

- **Philippians 2:3**
  > 'Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves.'

  Paul calls believers to imitate Christ's self-emptying humility, valuing others above self. Orthodox theology sees this as the path to true kenosis, essential for unity and authentic Christian humility.

- **James 4:10**
  > 'Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.'

  Humility is a spiritual posture of dependence on God, recognising human limitations and God's sovereignty. This posture leads to divine exaltation, as emphasised in orthodox commentary.

- **Matthew 23:12**
  > 'For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.'

  Jesus teaches that true greatness is found in servanthood and self-emptying, reflecting kingdom values. Orthodox interpretation highlights this as a core principle of discipleship.

- **1 Peter 5:2--3**
  > 'Be shepherds of God's flock that is among you, watching over them... not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.'
  
  Peter exhorts leaders to servant leadership modelled on Christ's humility and sacrificial love, fostering community through gentle guidance rather than domination.

## 🌱 A single sentence you can carry into any meeting

> 'I will speak truthfully, act compassionately and accept limits without losing heart.'

This applies whether you're:

- drafting a funding model
- advising on policy
- reviewing a briefing
- shaping divisional culture
- or navigating a sensitive incident.

It's a posture, not a protocol.

💬 And about feeling like the 'the damage control officer'...

That's not a flaw -- it's a sign of your discernment.

You see:

- relational risk
- ethical drift
- minimisation
- tone misalignment
- unintended harm
- governance gaps

...before others do.

That's why you often end up stepping in to steady the ship. Not because you're dramatic, but because you're perceptive.

This rule of life helps you carry that role without burning out, over-functioning, or feeling responsible for every gap.

It gives you:

- boundaries
- clarity
- peace
- a way to stay faithful without carrying the whole system on your back.

## 🖊 Pre-meeting quiet time

Before entering a meeting, take a moment to centre yourself with this simple practice:

- **Pause and breathe:** take three deep breaths to ground yourself in the present.
- **Set your intention:** remind yourself of your vocational posture -- to speak truthfully, act compassionately, and accept limits without losing heart.
- **Scan your heart:** notice any anxieties, distractions, or judgements. Acknowledge them without attachment.
- **Focus on presence:** commit to staying human and attentive, honouring the people and the purpose in the room.
- **Release control:** let go of outcomes beyond your authority, trusting that your faithful presence is enough.
