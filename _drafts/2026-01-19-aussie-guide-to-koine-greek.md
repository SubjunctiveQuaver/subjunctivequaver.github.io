> Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος.\\
> *En archē ēn ho logos, kai ho logos ēn pros ton theon, kai theos ēn ho logos.*\\
> **In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.**

-- <cite>John 1:1 (SBL Greek New Testament)</cite>

Hi everyone. I wanted to share a bit of a new journey in 2026 here -- one where I'm starting to learn a bit of **Biblical Greek**, also called **Koine Greek** (ἡ κοινὴ διάλεκτος, *hē koinē dialektos*).

I got a new Surface Pro over new years, because I want to be more intentional this year with my Bible study and content creation (including my new Instagram account, [@learnedlawrence](https://www.instagram.com/learnedlawrence/)). I've been using [Logos Bible Study Platform](https://www.logos.com/) to do my Bible study this year, which has been amazing and fruitful --  and that led me on a journey of starting to learn Biblical Greek.

Thanks to my mathematical training at university (and my general curiosity), I've known the letters of the Greek alphabet for a while, but I'm only now just learning their proper pronunciation and experiencing the fullness of this knowledge.

## Why Greek? Why bother?

For those that don't know, the Christian Bible was written up to around 2,000 years ago, around the time of Jesus Christ. There are 2 sections:

- the **Old Testament**, written in Hebrew from around 1400 to 400 BC
- the **New Testament**, written in Greek from around 45 to 100 AD.[^1]

[^1]: To make things more interesting, the everyday spoken language of Judea at the time was Aramaic (similar to Hebrew), which was the language Jesus spoke.

This means that the Bible versions we read today are all translations of original texts. The world has changed so much in the last 2,000 years, and it's easy to read the Bible with a modern bias. To facilitate proper **exegesis** -- which means to read in context and with the author's original intent preserved -- it's important to look back to the original language. Otherwise, we can go into **eisegesis**, where we read our own interpretations into the text.

In this post, I aim to create an easy-to-follow guide to reading Biblical Greek, especially for us Aussies out there. I'm also learning myself -- this is something that I pray you will be able to use if you want to learn as well. Come learn with me.

## The Greek alphabet

In the following sections, I'll be primarily referencing *An introduction to Biblical Greek: a grammar with exercises* by Schwandt, 2020.

You might have heard the saying:

> That looks Greek to me.

Well yep -- that's because Greek isn't written with the English alphabet. From classical to Biblical to modern times, Greek has used a consistent set of 24 letters in its alphabet.

I'm sure you're familiar with a few of the letters. In fact, if you've done maths, you might be familiar with a couple more:

- π (pi) for our favourite circle constant, approximately 3.1415
- θ (theta) for angles
- Σ (sigma) for summation notation and σ (sigma) for standard deviation
- μ (mu) for the mean in probability and statistics
- ξ (xi) for sample spaces in high school maths
- Ω (omega) for sample spaces in university maths
- Δ (delta) for the discriminant and differences, and δ (delta) for tiny changes
- ε (epsilon) for tiny quantities in limits (for all you analysts out there)
- φ (phi) for the golden ratio, approximately 1.618
- λ (lambda) for eigenvalues and parameters
- α (alpha) for statistical significance
- ρ (rho) for correlation and polar radius.

It's now time to meet the full family, in order. I'm using [Macquarie University's phonemic transcription of Australian English](https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-medicine-health-and-human-sciences/departments-and-schools/department-of-linguistics/our-research/phonetics-and-phonology/speech/phonetics-and-phonology/transcription/phonemic-broad-transcription-of-australian-english).

[^2]: For the Greek letter sigma, σ is used at the beginning or in the middle of a word, whereas ς is used when it is the final letter.

A note on pronuciation: there are 3 main systems for Greek pronunciation. Today, most readers follow one of three general strategies:

1. historically reconstructed models (Koine system)
2. anglicised academic models (Erasmian system)
3. the Modern Greek sound (Byzantine system).

This article tends to use the Koine system, with Erasmian notes where needed or where it aids distinction.

### Vowels: a deeper dive

In English, vowels can be deceivingly difficult for learners (even though they may seem natural for native speakers). For example, the vowel 'a' can be read as:

- /eː/ as in _h**ai**r_
- /e/ as in _h**ea**d_
- /æ/ as in _h**a**d_
- /ɐː/ as in _h**a**rd_
- /oː/ as in _s**aw**_
- /ɔ/ as in _w**a**s_
- /ə/ as in _**a**bout_
- /æɪ/ as in _s**ay**_
- /ɑe/ as in _Th**ai**_.

Linguists generally agree that Greek vowels are 'pure' and have stable, consistent pronunciations, unlike English vowels which vary widely. Here are the 7 single-letter vowels:

| Name    | Greek | Transliteration | IPA  | Vowel type                      | Australian English cue                             |
| ------- | ----- | --------------- | ---- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| alpha   | Αα    | *a*             | /a/  | low front (short)               | close to 'uh' as in _c**u**p_                      |
| epsilon | Εε    | *e*             | /e/  | mid front (short)               | 'e' as in _h**ea**d_                               |
| ēta     | Ηη    | *ē*             | /eː/ | mid front (long)                | 'air' as in _h**air**_ (long)                      |
| iōta    | Ιι    | *i*             | /i/  | high front (short/long)         | 'ee' as in _ver**y**_ (but short, clean)           |
| omicron | Οο    | *o*             | /o/  | mid back (short)                | 'o' as in _p**o**d_ (but a bit higher and rounder) |
| upsilon | Υυ    | *y*             | /y/  | high front rounded (short/long) | rounded 'ee' as in French _l**u**ne_               |
| ōmega   | Ωω    | *ō*             | /oː/ | mid back (long)                 | 'o' as in _s**aw**_ (long)                         |

Greek also has a number of *digraphs*, which are single vowels represented by 2 letters. (These are not *diphthongs*, which are combinations of 2 vowel sounds. Classical Greek had diphthongs, but they became pure by the time of Koine Greek.)

All Greek vowel digraphs end with a semivowel (ι or υ). When υ follows α or ε, it doesn’t act like a vowel but like a consonant: it sounds like English 'v' before voiced letters, and like 'f' before voiceless ones.

| ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| αι    | *ai*            | /e/          | mid front                 | like 'e' in _h**ea**d_ (merged with epsilon in Koine) |
| ει    | *ei*            | /i/          | high front (long)         | 'ee' as in _s**ee**_ (same as ι)                      |
| οι    | *oi*            | /i/          | high front (long)         | 'ee' as in _s**ee**_ (merged with upsilon in Koine)   |
| υι    | *yi*            | /i/ or /yi/  | high front (long)         | 'ee' with a slight rounded start                      |
| αυ    | *au*            | /av/ or /af/ | vowel + consonant cluster | 'uhv' as in _c**ov**er_ / 'af' as in _l**af**t_       |
| ευ    | *eu*            | /ev/ or /ef/ | vowel + consonant cluster | 'ev' as in _n**ev**er_ / 'ef' as in _l**ef**t_        |
| ου    | *ou*            | /uː/         | high back (long)          | 'oo' as in _f**oo**d_ (always “oo”)                   |
