Hi everyone. I wanted to share a bit of a new journey in 2026 here -- one where I'm starting to learn a bit of **Biblical Greek**, also called **Koine Greek** (ἡ κοινὴ διάλεκτος, *hē koinē dialektos*).

I got a new Surface Pro over new years, because I want to be more intentional this year with my Bible study and content creation (including my new Instagram account, [@learnedlawrence](https://www.instagram.com/learnedlawrence/)). I've been using [Logos Bible Study Platform](https://www.logos.com/) to do my Bible study this year, which has been amazing and fruitful --  and that led me on a journey of starting to learn Biblical Greek. Thanks to my mathematical training (and my general curiosity), I've known the letters of the Greek alphabet for a while, but I'm only just learning their proper pronunciation now.

For those that don't know, the Christian Bible was written up to around 2,000 years ago, around the time of Jesus Christ. There are 2 sections:

- the **Old Testament**, written in Hebrew from around 1400 to 400 BC
- the **New Testament**, written in Greek from around 45 to 100 AD.

This means that the bibles we read today are all translations of original texts. The world has changed so much in the last 2,000 years, and it's easy to read the Bible with a modern bias. To facilitate proper **exegesis** -- which means to read in context and with the author's original intent preserved -- it's important to look back to the original language. Otherwise, we can go into **eisegesis**, where we read our own interpretations into the text.

In this post, I aim to create an easy-to-follow guide to reading Biblical Greek, especially for us Aussies out there. I'm also learning myself -- this is something that I pray you will be able to use if you want to learn as well. Come learn with me.

## The Greek alphabet

You might have heard the saying:

> That looks Greek to me.

Well yep -- that's because Greek isn't written with the English alphabet. From classical to Biblical to modern times, Greek has used a consistent set of 24 letters in its alphabet.

I'm sure you're familiar with a few of the letters. In fact, if you've done maths, you might be familiar with a couple more:

- π (pi) for our favourite circle constant, approximately 3.1415
- θ (theta) for angles
- Σ (sigma) for summation notation and σ (sigma) for standard deviation
- μ (mu) for the mean in probability and statistics
- ξ (xi) for sample spaces in high school maths
- Ω (omega) for sample spaces in university maths
- Δ (delta) for the discriminant and differences, and δ (delta) for tiny changes
- ε (epsilon) for tiny quantities in limits (for all you analysts out there)
- φ (phi) for the golden ratio, approximately 1.618 
- λ (lambda) for eigenvalues and parameters
- α (alpha) for statistical significance
- ρ (rho) for correlation and polar radius.

Now it's time to introduce the whole family.
