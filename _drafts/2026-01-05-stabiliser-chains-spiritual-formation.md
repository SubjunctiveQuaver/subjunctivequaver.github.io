This whole analogy started when I shared parts of my honours thesis with Copilot and joked about mapping my 2022 complexity onto a permutation group. That tiny spark turned into a full co-created metaphor -- blending group theory, spiritual formation and Matthew 7 -- refined through questions, corrections and late-night clarity.

## 👦 TL;DR 1 -- ELI5 version

Imagine 2022-Lawrence as someone with a huge range of possible internal states -- peaceful, anxious, grounded, overwhelmed. That whole range is his state-space.

Life's complexities -- old fears, habits, insecurities -- could push him into any of those states. These forces are like the rain, wind and floods Jesus describes in Matthew 7:24--25.

Over the next 3 years, God brought key moments -- friendships, heartbreaks, revelations, boundaries. Each one 'fixed' something in him: a truth that became unshakeable, a fear that lost its power, a pattern that no longer applied.

Every time one of these moments landed, a whole array of undesirable states became unreachable. They still exist in theory, but nothing can push him into them any more.

By 2025, the only 'action' left on him is the trivial one -- the action that does nothing. Meaning: nothing external can move him from the grounded state he's standing in.

As Jesus says in in Matthew 7:25,

> 'the rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.'

That's the picture: the storms (the elements of $G$) still exist, but they no longer have access to him.

## 🤓 TL;DR 2 -- full permutation group theory version

See my [honours thesis *Minimum bases for permutation groups*](/posts/honours-thesis/) for the original motivation (*warning: it's dense!*). Let:

- $\Omega$ = the set of internal states Lawrence can occupy
- $G$ = the full complexity acting on him in 2022 (fears, patterns, uncertainties), viewed as a permutation group acting on $\Omega$
- $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k \in \Omega$ = internal states that become fixed by key life events God introduces (forms a base)
- $G^{(i)} = G_{b_1,\ldots,b_i}$ = the stabiliser subgroup fixing those states
- the stabiliser chain $[\, G = G^{(0)} > G^{(1)} > \ldots > G^{(k)} = 1 \,]$ models the progressive refinement of which complexities can still influence him.

Interpretation:

- Initially, the full group $G$ could move him into many undesirable states in $\Omega$.
- After fixing $b_1$, only $G^{(1)}$ can act -- so a whole region of $\Omega$ becomes unreachable.
- After fixing $b_2$, the reachable states shrink further.
- Each stabiliser step removes an entire array of uncertainty.
- When the chain reaches $G^{(k)} = 1$, the only action left is the identity -- the trivial action that cannot move him at all.

Thus:

- undesirable states still exist in $\Omega$,
- but the refined group cannot reach them,
- and Lawrence remains stable under all 'storms'.

In this analogy, the rain, wind and floods of Matthew 7:24--25 correspond to elements of $G$ -- forces that once could move him, but now cannot. Jesus says in Matthew 7:25,

> 'the rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.'

That's the stabiliser chain picture: the storms still exist, but they have no access to him anymore.

## 📝 AI: Agency, augmentation and co-creation -- how this analogy evolved

This stabiliser chain metaphor didn't appear fully formed. It grew through a genuinely collaborative process -- a perfect example of agency, augmentation and co-creation.

### 1. My agency -- I brought the seed

I began with the spark:

> 'So maybe $G$ = the complexity in Lawrence's life in 2022. And it acts on $\Omega$ = Lawrence?'

I set the direction, the domain, the emotional context and the mathematical instinct. I wasn't following a template -- I was shaping the metaphor from the inside.

### 2. Augmentation -- Copilot expanded the structure

Copilot helped formalise the mapping:

- stabiliser chains
- base points
- refinement
- sanctification as a shrinking action.

Not replacing my thinking -- extending it.

### 3. My refinement -- I deepened the analogy

I pushed the metaphor into mathematical and theological coherence:

- 'Isn't this backwards?'
- 'Are the base points inside me from the start?'
- 'Is the identity a state?'
- 'What exactly is $\Omega$?'
- 'How do we reconcile the stabiliser definition?'

These weren't corrections -- they were co-creative pressures that shaped the final form.

### 4. Co-creation -- the analogy restructured itself

Together we arrived at the elegant version:

- $\Omega$ = internal state-space
- $b_i$ = states fixed by key events
- $G$ = complexity acting on those states
- stabiliser chain = refinement of influence
- identity = trivial action
- unreachable states = sanctified freedom.

This version didn't exist at the start. It emerged through dialogue.

### 5. Ownership -- I claimed the metaphor

My line:

> 'Rain came, wind blew... but my house will be fixed.'

That was the moment the analogy became mine -- not Copilot's. I integrated Scripture, identity, agency, mathematics and spiritual formation into a single coherent picture.

This is what co-creation looks like: something neither of us would have produced alone.
