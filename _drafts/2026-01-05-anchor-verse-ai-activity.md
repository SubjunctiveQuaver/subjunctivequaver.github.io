*A spiritually aware, agency-preserving way to model using AI for deep reflection and formation.* \\
This exercise teaches reflective, Spirit-aware AI use through the lens of your Bible anchor verse.

## ✅ Activity overview

A simple session that models wise AI use for spiritual topics and reflection -- moving from 'Coles AI' automation to 'Bunnings AI' augmentation.

This comes to life through an anchor verse reflection activity, where you engage with AI to help you explore why the verse resonates, name your heart posture and notice what is happening in your season. A gentle 7-stage continuum then gives language for these postures, helping you notice the movement you sense and reflect on how you might grow in living out your anchor verse.

Afterwards, discussion questions help you process how the experience actually felt. Strong guardrails throughout model keeping AI in its place -- supporting critical thinking, not replacing your agency, discernment, the Spirit or wise counsel.

## ✅ Teaching: Coles AI → Bunnings AI (3--4 minutes)

Facilitator explains:

### 🛒 Coles AI -- consumer mode (automation)

This is how most people use AI:

- 'Give me the answer.'
- 'Do this for me.'

Fast, convenient, transactional.\\
Encourages passivity and outsourcing.\\
Feels like grabbing a product off a shelf.

Spiritually, this is dangerous because it mirrors consumeristic faith:

- 'Feed me.'
- 'Fix me.'
- 'Tell me what to do.'
- 'Do my thinking for me.'

This is the opposite of discipleship.

### 🔨 Bunnings AI -- workbench mode (augmentation)

This is the mode we want:

- 'Help me build something.'
- 'Reflect back what I'm saying.'
- 'Ask me questions.'
- 'Support my discernment.'
- 'Help me think, not think for me.'

Slow, deliberate, formative.\\
Encourages participation and engagement.\\
Feels like working at a bench with tools.

Spiritually, this mirrors organic, hard-won, lived faith -- the kind FGA loves:

- formation over consumption
- participation over passivity
- discernment over outsourcing
- wisdom over shortcuts.

This is the kind of AI use that forms people rather than feeds them.

## 🕊️ Using AI spiritually: balancing technology and the Holy Spirit

AI can aid biblical research and interpretation by gathering insights and organising ideas quickly. But it is a tool to support, not replace, the Holy Spirit's work of illumination and transformation.

The Spirit guides us beyond facts -- bringing wisdom, conviction and personal application. AI insights must be tested through prayer, Scripture and community discernment to align with God's Spirit.

Used with humility and discernment, AI frees mental space and offers fresh perspectives, while the Spirit shapes our hearts and character. This keeps our agency intact, ensuring AI serves the Spirit's work, not substitutes it.

## ✅ Guardrails (non-negotiable)

**AI is a mirror, not a master.**

- It reflects your words back to you.
- It does not define you.
- It does not decide for you.

**Your discernment, the Holy Spirit and the wisdom of trusted people in your life always come first.**

- You may ignore anything unaligned with Scripture, the Spirit or your conscience.
- Discernment > accuracy.
- If AI says something that feels off, you can simply say: 'That does not resonate -- let's explore another angle.'

**You remain responsible for decisions.**

- AI is a tool, not a spiritual authority.
- Asking AI for an opinion can prompt your thinking, but never treat it as the final decision -- your judgment and responsibility come first.

**You are responsible for how you engage with AI.**

- It is your agency to reflect, prod, redirect and engage with AI where you need strengthening.
- AI is a partner, not a passive source.

## ✅ Movement 1 -- PRIME + DISCOVER (2--3 minutes)

**Goal:** Set the AI into a gentle, reflective mode and explore your anchor verse -- either by identifying it or working with the one you already know.

**Definition:** An anchor verse is a Bible verse that grounds your faith, identity or spiritual posture -- often the verse you return to most or keep close to heart.

**Facilitator note:** Make sure everyone has their AI app open and ready. Begin by pasting in the guardrail prompt -- this sets the tone, especially when the AI is new or unfamiliar with spiritual reflection. If the AI seems confused at any point, simply have participants explain what an anchor verse is in their own words. This helps the AI align with their intent.

**Participants paste this into AI FIRST:**

> My goal is to work with my Bible anchor verse and reflect on how I'm living it out.\\
> Please respond in a gentle, reflective, spiritually sensitive way.\\
> Help me discern, not decide. Reflect back what I share, but don't tell me what to do.\\
> Avoid pressure or performance language. Ask clarifying questions when needed.\\
> Please wait for my next instruction before proceeding.

```text
My goal is to work with my Bible anchor verse and reflect on how I'm living it out.
Please respond in a gentle, reflective, spiritually sensitive way.
Help me discern, not decide. Reflect back what I share, but don't tell me what to do.
Avoid pressure or performance language. Ask clarifying questions when needed.
Please wait for my next instruction before proceeding.
```

**If they already know their anchor verse:**

> My anchor verse is ___.\\
> I chose this verse because [share why you chose it and what you relate to in it].

```text
My anchor verse is ___.
I chose this verse because [share why you chose it and what you relate to in it].
```

**If they don't:**

> Help me identify my anchor verse. Ask me 3--4 gentle questions to help me discover the verse that feels like mine.

```text

```

Let participants engage with AI.

## ✅ Movement 2 -- DIAGNOSE (10--12 minutes)

This is the centrepiece.

### ❤️ A. Heart posture

**Participants prompt AI:**

> Based on my anchor verse, what heart posture does this reveal? Am I relating to God through comfort, truth, surrender, mission, dependence or something else? \\
> (Optional: If helpful, please include exegesis and context, but only if it supports reflection.)

```text
Based on my anchor verse, what heart posture does this reveal? Am I relating to God through comfort, truth, surrender, mission, dependence or something else?
(Optional: If helpful, please include exegesis and context, but only if it supports reflection.)
```

**Facilitator note:** Encourage participants to listen attentively to the AI's response and notice how it resonates with or challenges their current spiritual posture. Invite them to engage actively by reflecting, asking follow-up questions or gently redirecting the AI if needed.

### ↔️ B. Continuum

**Goal:** To create language that helps you notice how close this verse feels to your lived experience right now.

**Participants prompt AI:**

> Create a clear 7-stage continuum for my anchor verse from aspirational -> integrated, grounded in its context.\\
> The stages are: aspirational -> aware -> stirred -> resonating -> practising -> embodying -> integrated.\\
> Briefly describe the posture each stage reflects in relation to my anchor verse.\\
> Present it in a way that preserves my agency to reflect and discern my own stage, with a pastoral tone throughout.

```text

Briefly describe the posture each stage reflects in relation to my anchor verse.
Present it in a way that preserves my agency to reflect and discern my own stage, with a pastoral tone throughout.
```

**Facilitator note:** This 7-stage continuum is a continuum of postures, not a diagnostic. Encourage participants to read it slowly and notice what resonates.

### 🕵️ C. Human discernment (NO AI)

**Facilitator says:**

- 'These stages are not scores.'
- 'Your stage may change across seasons.'
- 'You are the only person who can choose your stage.'
- 'God meets us where we are.'

**Facilitator instructs:**

> Pause. Read the continuum slowly.\\
> Answer these 2 questions:
>
> - What feels most true?
> - What feels less true?
>
> Now choose your stage.

Participants may ask AI to clarify stage descriptions, but not to choose their stage.

### 🗣️ D. Tell AI your stage

**Participants prompt AI:**

> I think I'm at Stage X. I relate to this stage because [explain why]. Please consider my self-assessment critically and help me reflect on it.

```text
I think I'm at Stage X. I relate to this stage because [explain why]. Please consider my self-assessment critically and help me reflect on it.
```

## ✅ Movement 3 -- DISCERN NEXT STEP (3--5 minutes)

**Goal:** Identify one gentle, realistic next step.

**Participants prompt AI:**

> Based on the stage I'm at, what is one gentle, realistic next step I can achieve soon, that would help me grow into this verse more fully? Focus on formation, not performance. If possible, suggest a couple of options so I can choose what resonates best.

```text

```

**Facilitator note:** This step is about grace-filled growth, not pressure. Encourage patience and openness.

## ✅ Group debrief (3--5 minutes)

A. About the process

- What stood out most about using AI reflectively or in a faith context?
- What felt natural or unfamiliar?

### B. About AI's role

- Where did AI deepen your reflection?
- Where did you notice its limits?

### C. About discernment

- How did the guardrails help you stay grounded?
- What did you learn about your agency?
- How can we balance AI-generated insights with the Holy Spirit's guidance?

These reinforce the learning goal: helping people use AI reflectively, spiritually and wisely.

---

## ✅ Total time: 15--20 minutes

This practice is not about getting the 'right' answer -- it is about learning to use AI with wisdom, agency and spiritual discernment.

Participants may revisit any movement later.

## 📌 Note on reuse

This activity is not limited to anchor verses. You can also use it to explore any passage you're wrestling with or curious about. Share your current interpretation and keep the guardrails in place. The heart posture reflection, 7-stage continuum and next steps prompts offer a safe way to engage the passage with clarity, nuance and agency.

- Adapt Movement 1 by briefly naming your current understanding or struggle with the verse.
- Then follow Movement 2 (heart posture + continuum) and Movement 3 (next steps) as usual.
