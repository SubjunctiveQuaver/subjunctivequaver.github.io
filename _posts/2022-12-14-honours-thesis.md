I'm really excited to share my completed honours thesis! I'm honoured that my supervisors (and apparently the examiners too haha) were pleased with the result, and I'm humbled that my effort this year has led to graduating with first class honours --- I owe it all to those who were there for me: my family, friends (especially my honours friends, church friends, Chris, and Wes), and God, whose love and presence sustained me through the tumultuous times.

My research was in *minimum bases for permutation groups*. A permutation group is, loosely speaking, a collection of *permutations* of a set (essentially rearrangements of the set) which, when applied in succession, remains in the collection; the reverse permutation must also be in the collection, as well as the identity *(do nothing)* permutation. A *base* is a collection of points in the set being permuted, such that if a permutation in the collection fixes every point in the base, then that permutation must be the identity. My goal was to talk about what is known about the smallest possible size of a base of a given permutation group, using the `GAP` computational language, and with original instructive examples interwoven throughout.

Below is my final honours presentation. I motivated my research using the Rubik's group (permutations of the Rubik's cube), which is one of the many applications of permutation groups, and one that is close to my heart (thanks Wes). I tried to make it somewhat fun and engaging with the Rubik's cube example --- I hope you will find it as interesting as I did!

While I might not be doing as much maths in the future, I hope to continue to review and share some more interesting things I've learnt along my mathematical journey. Thanks for coming along this journey with me, and I look forward to continuing in my new role at the [Department of Education and Training](https://education.vic.gov.au/) and working towards better outcomes for education across our state!
