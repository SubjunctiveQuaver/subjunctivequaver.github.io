Make sure you read [part 1](https://subjunctivequaver.github.io/posts/integrating-rational-functions/) first! Recall that we were exploring integrating rational functions, and to do so, we needed to look at partial fraction decompositions. As we now begin to discuss that in detail, we first look more closely at polynomial rings (over fields).

## Polynomial rings over fields

### Polynomial division with remainder, and the factor theorem

### Evaluating polynomials in (extension) fields

### Conjugate root theorem for real polynomials

### Complete factorisation of real polynomials

**Theorem.** Every real polynomial $$p \in \mathbb R[\mathrm x]$$ can be factorised over $$\mathbb R$$ into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors

## Existence and uniqueness of partial fraction decompositions

It also works over any Euclidean domain!!

### Partial fractions for the rationals: an algorithm

## Solving the original problem: integrating rational functions

To be continued...
