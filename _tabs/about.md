I'm currently working as a graduate data analyst at the [Department of Education and Training, Victoria](https://education.vic.gov.au/). In 2022, I completed my honours year in pure maths at Monash University, achieving first class honours. I have also completed an undergraduate double degree, majoring in pure maths and econometrics (also at Monash University). I have previously worked as a teaching associate at Monash University, instructing classes in algebra, calculus and discrete maths.

My honours research was in group theory, on *minimum bases for permutation groups*, with A/Prof. Heiko Dietrich and Dr Santiago Barrera Acevedo as my supervisors. I love sharing interesting things that I learn, and I hope that this blog will contain some epic content that you will enjoy! Feel free to join us on the unofficial [Maths @ Monash Discord server](https://discord.gg/hx63ZwSXBg)!

My other passions include music (in particular Taylor Swift lol), transport, geography, history and science. One thing that I realised upon reflection near the end of my honours year was that despite going into full-time work not directly related to my field of study, I am eternally grateful for this God-given opportunity to spend 2022 studying something I'm passionate about. The following verse helped me get through these bittersweet feelings at the end:

"There is a time for everything,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a season for every activity under the heavens"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV)

By the way, if you understand the meaning behind the blog icon... good job :D
