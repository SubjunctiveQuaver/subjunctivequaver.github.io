I'm currently an honours student studying pure maths at Monash University (as of 2022), with an undergraduate degree in pure maths and econometrics (also at Monash University). I am also a teaching assistant at Monash University, and I really like music (in particular Taylor Swift lol). My honours research this year is in group theory, on *minimum bases for permutation groups*, with A/Prof. Heiko Dietrich and Dr Santiago Barrera Acevedo as my supervisors. I love sharing interesting things that I learn, and I hope that this blog will contain some epic content that you will enjoy! Feel free to join us on the unofficial [Maths @ Monash Discord server](https://discord.gg/hx63ZwSXBg)!

By the way, if you understand the meaning behind the blog icon... good job :D
