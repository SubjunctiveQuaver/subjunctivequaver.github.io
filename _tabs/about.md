I'm a 4th year undergraduate student studying (pure) maths and econometrics at Monash University. I love sharing interesting things that I learn, and I hope that this blog will contain some epic content that you will enjoy! Feel free to join us on the unofficial [Maths @ Monash Discord server](https://discord.gg/hx63ZwSXBg)!

By the way, if you understand the meaning behind the blog icon... good job :D
