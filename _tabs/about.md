**Welcome to my blog, *Forms and Formation*!**

I'm Lawrence, and I work as a data analyst in the Victorian public service, currently at the Department of Education. My academic background is in mathematics: in 2022, I completed first‑class honours in pure mathematics at Monash University, following an undergraduate double degree in pure maths and econometrics.

During my studies, I worked as a teaching associate at Monash University, teaching classes in algebra, calculus, and discrete mathematics. My honours research was in group theory, focusing on [*minimum bases for permutation groups*](https://subjunctivequaver.github.io/posts/honours-thesis/), supervised by A/Prof Heiko Dietrich and Dr Santiago Barrera Acevedo.

Although my day‑to‑day work is no longer directly academic, I remain deeply shaped by mathematical thinking -- especially ideas of structure, equivalence, and transformation. This blog began as *Epic Maths Time*, a place to share mathematical curiosities, but is shifting into a space for reflecting on how structure and formation unfolds across different domains.

Alongside mathematics, I'm particularly interested in theology, music (yes, including Taylor Swift), transport and reflective AI use. I'm drawn to the ways these fields intersect -- how patterns repeat, how systems evolve and how meaning emerges over time.

I'm grateful for the opportunity I had to spend 2022 immersed in a subject I love, and for the ways that season continues to shape me. One verse that stayed with me during that season was:

"There is a time for everything,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a season for every activity under the heavens"\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV)

While it spoke most directly to that moment, I still find its wisdom shaping how I think about seasons, formation and the work this blog is becoming -- *formed by structure, transformed by grace*.

And yes -- if you understand the meaning behind the blog icon (think *series*), good job 🙂
